<p class="center">A DARK NIGHT'S SECRET.</p>


<p>A night of storm and tempest, the wind blowing a
perfect gale; and above its mad shrieking the sullen
roar of the ocean, as it beat against the shore in angry
vehemence, recoiling with wrathful force, as though to
gather strength for a fresh onslaught. The little town
of Chester, Massachusetts, near the beach, lay wrapped
in gloom and darkness, under the lowering midnight
sky, "while the rains descended and the floods came."
It was a terrible night, that tenth of November. One
man was destined to remember that night as long as
he lived. Alone in his dingy little office, Doctor Frederick
Lynne sat, absorbed in the contents of a medical
journal, his grave face bent over the printed page upon
which his eyes were fixed with eager interest, while
the moments came and went unnoticed. He closed the
journal at last with an impatient gesture, and pushed
it aside. Arising slowly to his feet&mdash;a tall, dark, elderly
man, with a troubled, anxious expression&mdash;he
went slowly over to the bright wood-fire which burned
upon the broad hearth, and stood gazing down into
the bed of rosy coals, the anxious look deepening in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
his eyes. A poor country physician, with a wife and
child depending upon his exertions, he found the
struggle for subsistence growing harder every day.</p>

<p>"Ugh! what a night!" he muttered, "I dread to
start for home. I believe I will wait until the storm
subsides a little. Heigh-ho!" clasping his hands behind
his head with a weary little gesture; "if only the
struggle were not quite so hard&mdash;so desperate! If
only I need not slave as I do! Hard work and poor
pay. It is enough to make a man discouraged, especially
a man with a wife like mine. She is always
longing and wishing for fine clothes, and a better home
and all the luxuries that only money can supply. It
drives me nearly mad at times; and there's no way of
escape only to come down here to the office and lock
myself in. Heavens! I wish that I were rich. I
would do almost anything in the world for money;
anything&mdash;<i>almost</i>."</p>

<p>Tap, tap, tap, at the outer door of the office.</p>

<p>The entire building consisted of two rooms&mdash;a private
consulting-room, and the office proper, which
opened out upon the long, straight village street, with
its sleepy-looking stores and the great, bare, unpainted
hotel, which seemed perennially empty.</p>

<p>At sound of that unexpected summons, Doctor Lynne
started in surprise. For five long years he had occupied
that office, whose weather-beaten shingle told
the passers-by that Frederick Lynne, M. D., might be
found within; but never before within memory had he
been summoned upon a night like this. Sickness was
at a discount in healthy Chester, where people usually
died of old age. But as he stood there, staring vacantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
about him, trying to persuade himself that it
had been only a freak of the imagination, once more
that ghostly tapping sounded upon the stout oaken
panels of the office door.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> some one!" ejaculated the astonished physician,
going swiftly to the door and unbolting it.</p>

<p>"You'd better be all night about it," growled a voice
from the door-step; and Lynne saw before him a tall
man wrapped in a long dark cloak, the high collar
turned up about his ears, a broad-brimmed sombrero
pulled down over his brows so that no feature of the
face was visible save a pair of flashing dark eyes and
a prominent nose.</p>

<p>"Doctor Lynne, I presume?" queried the stranger.</p>

<p>The physician bowed.</p>

<p>"I am Doctor Lynne, sir," he returned, simply. "Are
my services required?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait a moment."</p>

<p>The physician stood there in the open door, through
which the wind swept madly, nearly extinguishing the
dim light of the little oil lamp upon the reading-table,
his astonished eyes fixed upon an unwonted spectacle.
A closed carriage which stood without, its driver, enveloped
in an oil-skin coat, sitting like a statue upon the
box. The stranger walked swiftly to the carriage door
and opened it. A pause ensued, during which Doctor
Lynne began to feel strangely uncomfortable; then,
to his relief, the stranger reappeared at the office door,
bearing in his arms the slight figure of a woman.</p>

<p>"Have you any brandy or other stimulant?" he
asked, as he placed the limp, unresisting figure upon
the old-fashioned sofa which stood in a corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. Shall I administer some? The lady is&mdash;ill?"</p>

<p>"Very ill. Will you kindly take charge of her
while I go to the hotel and make arrangements for our
reception there? This lady is my wife. She was taken
suddenly ill on the road, and I am a stranger here."</p>

<p>Doctor Lynne was hurriedly searching the old-fashioned
corner cupboard for brandy and other restoratives.</p>

<p>"I will do all in my power, certainly," he returned.
"Have you come far?"</p>

<p>He turned swiftly as he spoke and found that the
stranger had disappeared. The physician rushed to
the door and peered out into the night and storm. The
carriage had disappeared also; there was no one to be
seen. A strange oppression settled slowly down upon
Doctor Lynne's spirits; he closed the door and went
back to the fire. The silent figure upon the sofa had
neither moved nor stirred; the face was hidden from
view by a thick veil. But as the doctor paused before
the fire to measure some brandy into the glass in his
hand, the silence of the room was broken by an unexpected
sound&mdash;<i>the cry of a little child</i>.</p>

<p>With a start of surprise Doctor Lynne hastened to
the sofa, and saw for the first time that the sick
woman held a child in her arms. He stooped and
attempted to remove it&mdash;a lovely, smiling little creature
of some nine or ten months.</p>

<p>"Allow me, madame," he began, gently. "The babe
is too heavy, and you are ill. What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>No answer. No sound to break the silence of the
stormy night. Only, off in the distance the shriek of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
an engine as the down express&mdash;having halted as usual
at the station&mdash;the brief pause which was considered
long enough for a dead-and-alive place like Chester&mdash;dashed
madly on its way once more. Doctor Lynne's
eyes sought the silent, recumbent form of the woman,
and something in her attitude and the strange and
inexplicable silence that she maintained struck to his
heart with an uneasy sensation.</p>

<p>"Madame," he repeated, venturing to lay his hand
upon her shoulder, "you are ill&mdash;suffering. Tell me,
where is the pain?"</p>

<p>No answer. Something in that awful silence made
his heart grow faint and cold. He lifted his hand and
swiftly, reverently removed the veil from the woman's
face. With a cry of horror he recoiled from the sight.
The woman was <i>dead</i>&mdash;dead and cold, and had been
for hours!</p>

<p>He rushed to the door, and opening it glared wildly
out into the night and darkness. There was no sign
of any living creature. Doctor Lynne closed the door
once more and went back to the silent figure upon the
sofa. The face before him was very beautiful&mdash;a
woman of some five-and-twenty years. The body was
attired in handsome garments, and one hand&mdash;a beautiful
white hand, with a plain gold ring upon the third
finger&mdash;grasped, even in death, a tiny vial. The vial
was empty, but it bore the hideous skull and crossbones,
together with the significant legend: "Laudanum&mdash;poison."</p>

<p>Clasped in the death-cold arms lay the child, a
lovely little girl; while pinned to its dainty white slip
was a folded paper addressed to "Doctor Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Lynne." Bewildered at the strange occurrences, the
physician hurriedly opened the folded paper and read
these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doctor Frederick Lynne</span>,&mdash;You have wished
many a time for wealth; the chance to acquire a competence
is now in your grasp. Keep this child and
rear it as your own, and every year a sum of money
sufficient for her support and that of your entire
family shall be forwarded to you, on condition that
you make no effort to discover the child's parents or
antecedents. Should you attempt such a discovery the
remittance will cease. But remember this, she is of
good family, well-born, and legitimate. You may call
her <i>Beatrix Dane</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Accompanying the letter was a crisp one thousand-dollar
bill. This was all, but surely it was enough
to make the worthy physician stare in surprise.</p>

<p>Inquiry the next morning elicited the information
that a strange man had suddenly appeared at the station
the night previous and boarded the down express.
The carriage had disappeared as mysteriously as it had
come, no one knew whither. The whole affair was
shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>The coroner's inquest resulted in the verdict of
"Death from laudanum, administered by some person
unknown." The body was buried away in the village
grave-yard, and Doctor Lynne took the infant to his
humble home. It was received unwillingly enough by
Mrs. Lynne&mdash;a hard-featured, high-tempered woman,
who ruled her husband and household with a rod of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
iron; but for the sake of the money she consented
reluctantly to receive the child. And so Beatrix Dane
grew up to womanhood; but before she reached her
seventeenth year the remittances ceased, and the black
shadow of poverty brooded over the cheerless home of
the Lynnes. "Troubles never come singly." So just
at this juncture Doctor Lynne was stricken with partial
paralysis of the limbs, which would render
him an invalid for life. All the future looked gloomy
and threatening, and the gaunt wolf hovered at the
door of the Lynnes' humble home.</p>

<p class="center">HER FAIRY PRINCE.</p>


<p>"Any letters, Mr. Grey?"</p>

<p>The voice was low and eager. The girl to whom
the voice belonged paused before the dingy counter
of the country store and post-office combined, and
stood patiently waiting. The postmaster, a rosy-faced
old gentleman, with a superabundance of bald head,
glanced over the meager assortment of epistolary communications
in the little lettered boxes before him, and
shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"No! Oh&mdash;yes, to be sure! Wait a moment, if you
please, Miss Beatrix," he corrected himself, pouncing
upon a large white envelope, which he placed upon
the counter before her with an air of satisfaction.
"Here you are! I nigh overlooked it. It's for your
pa&mdash;see&mdash;'Doctor Frederick Lynne, Chester, Mass.,'
and postmarked New Orleans. Now, who kin it be
from? Your pa got any relative down South? No,"&mdash;(as
the girl shook her head decidedly)&mdash;"I thought
not. I've knowed Doctor Lynne these one-and-twenty
years, and I never heerd him talk o' no relatives down
South. How's your ma, Miss Beatrix?"</p>

<p>The girl's dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"My mother?" she repeated, with a little tinge of
contempt in her sweet voice. "You mean Mrs. Lynne?
You will please remember, Mr. Grey, that although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
call Doctor Lynne father, his wife is not my mother."</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Waal, I declar'! But still, arter all,
you're right. You're putty nigh always right, Miss
Trix. Nothin' more today?" he added, anxiously, as
having slipped the letter into her pocket, the girl was
about to move away.</p>

<p>"No. Yes, there is. You may cut me off fifteen
yards of that garnet merino, if you please, Mr. Grey.
Papa said that I might, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Miss Beatrix; it's all right. And mercy
knows you need a new dress! Think you'll be able to
carry such a big bundle all the way home? Yes?
Waal, young folks orter be strong, and you always was
able to take keer o' yourself. So, Miss Beatrix"&mdash;measuring
off the soft folds of merino with deft fingers&mdash;"you
don't 'pear to like Mrs. Lynne? Waal,
'tain't in natur' for a gal to keer as much for a 'dopted
mother as she would for her own. Your mother&mdash;no
one here knows who she was, Miss Trix; but when I
looked upon her dead face, I declar' I thought I was
a-lookin' at the face o' an angel."</p>

<p>The girl's dark eyes filled with tears, but she choked
them bravely back.</p>

<p>"We will not speak of her now, if you please, Mr.
Grey," she suggested. "And, really, I must make
haste home, for it is getting late."</p>

<p>Mr. Grey took off his huge steel-bowed spectacles
and rubbed them vigorously upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>"To be sure. The days is gettin' shorter, for a fact.
November is a dreary month hereabouts; and, upon
my word, Miss Trix, I really believe it's goin' to snow.
And you have two good miles to walk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I know. I would have come earlier, but
Mrs. Lynne objected, and of course I dared not disobey.
Then papa glanced up from his books&mdash;since
his affliction all he can do is to read and write, you
know&mdash;he glanced up from his books long enough to
see that I was really anxious to go, and then he happened
to remember that we had not heard from the
post-office in three days&mdash;three whole days&mdash;and so
he gave me permission. But I must make haste, for
it is five o'clock, and it will be dark before six."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;to be sure, Miss Beatrix. Good-night,
my dear. I hope you'll reach home all right."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Nothing will harm me, I am sure.
Good-night."</p>

<p>The door of the weather-beaten old building opened
and closed behind her, and the girl stood alone under
the gray of the November sky&mdash;a slight, slim figure in
a dowdyish brown serge gown, and a hat of last year's
fashion&mdash;a graceful little figure with a face of rare
beauty. Pale, colorless complexion, with straight, delicate
features, and large, velvety dark eyes, and a mass
of gold-brown hair, Beatrix Dane was well worth looking
at as she stood there; for even her common&mdash;not
to say shabby&mdash;attire did not conceal the exquisite
grace and beauty of her face and form. For a moment
she stood gazing about her, then with a low sigh she
hastened away.</p>

<p>Two weary miles lay between the little country town
and the cheerless home of Doctor Lynne whom she
looked upon as an own father; but the hard-hearted
mistress of the house could never stand in the place of
a mother to the lonely girl. She was thinking of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
now as she hastened over the hard, frozen road, the
sun sinking slowly out of sight in the gloomy west, a
light fall of snow beginning slowly to descend.</p>

<p>"How I wish I were rich!" she exclaimed, half
aloud; "then I would not live in a place like this, away
from the world. And I would have my own carriage
and need not walk. It must be delightful to have all
the money you wish, and not have to wear the same
old gown forever&mdash;a dyed old gown, too, which is
positively hideous."</p>

<p>She drew the gayly colored plaid shawl that she
wore closer about her shoulders to keep out the chill
evening air, and she shuddered involuntarily as her
eyes fell upon the ugly wrap. The girl was an artist
by nature, and anything incongruous or out of harmony
jarred upon her like a shock, while any unfortunate
mistake in the blending of colors would send a
chill through her artistic soul.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish my fairy prince would come!"
she cried, half laughingly, "and rescue me from my
unpleasant surroundings. My fairy prince! Like the
princes in the story-books, he must be young, rich,
and handsome; courteous and&mdash;and everything nice.
He must be tall and graceful, with soft dark eyes, and
hair as black as midnight; a sweet mouth, but firm
and resolute, and a determined chin. I have seen a
picture like that&mdash;where was it? Oh, yes; in Mrs.
Lynne's photograph album. I asked her who it was,
and she told me that it was no concern of mine. To
be sure, it was not; but then I only asked a civil answer
to a harmless question. Ah, Mrs. Lynne! you
will be the death of me yet&mdash;you and your ugly daughter!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Serena Lynne and I can never live as sisters.
The thought of it makes me long for the coming of my
Prince Charming, who will take me away to peace and
happiness. I wish my own father would come for me.
I wish my own mother had not died. I&mdash;I&mdash;Good
gracious! <i>what is that</i>?"</p>

<p>She came to a frightened halt, gazing about her
with terror-dilated eyes. A few rods before her a
little river remained to be crossed&mdash;a narrow stream,
but very deep and with a very rapid current. Spanning
the stream was a dilapidated bridge, which had
already been condemned for the use of vehicles; but
still a few venturesome pedestrians trusted their lives
upon its frail strength. Beatrix had crossed upon the
bridge; she had fully expected to return in that way;
but now, as she came to a frightened halt, the sound
of a horse's feet broke the silence, and she beheld an
unexpected scene. Just before her, half-way over the
bridge, she saw a big black horse, and upon his back a
man&mdash;a young man&mdash;a stranger in that vicinity. He
was crossing the dilapidated structure without a suspicion
that it was unsafe. Even as the girl's eyes fell
upon the scene, <i>crash</i>! went the rotten timbers. There
was a wild cry, a rush through space, then the thud
of a falling body as man and horse struck the swift-flowing
current below. The horse, once freed from its
rider, swam swiftly toward the shore and reached the
opposite bank, up which it scrambled and soon disappeared.
Pale and trembling, the girl crept close to
the river-bank, and glanced over. She could see that
tall, dark form battling manfully with the waves; the
river was deepest and swiftest at this point&mdash;the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ice-cold. If the swimmer was able to keep up for a
time, he must soon succumb to the cold, half-frozen
element. She stood transfixed with horror, her eyes
riveted upon the dark figure rising and falling with
the current as he strove to keep himself afloat, and
made a desperate fight for life.</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy!" cried the girl; "must he
die there alone? Oh, what shall I do? What can I
do?"</p>

<p>There was no one within a mile of the spot. Long
before she could summon help he would have sunk to
the bottom, chilled through and through. How could
he long persist in his mad efforts to save himself? All
at once an inspiration rushed into the girl's heart&mdash;a
slim chance, but it seemed the only one. Fortunately,
the stream, though so deep and swift, was not wide.
Her plan seemed feasible. Removing the long, stout
shawl from her shivering shoulders, she crept to the
very edge of the bank and leaned over. The swimmer
was nearly paralyzed from the cold, and was fast giving
up; but his eyes fell upon the girl, and he saw at
once what she was trying to do.</p>

<p>"Can you swim near enough to reach it?" she
called aloud.</p>

<p>For answer he made one more desperate effort;
then she saw for the first time that he had been injured
in some way by the falling timbers&mdash;one of his
limbs seemed nearly useless. But with superhuman
efforts he strove to swim within reach of that bright
colored banner streaming out upon the water. A little
nearer&mdash;a little nearer! He was faint and chilled to
the bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>She leaned far over the brink of the stream, her
teeth set hard together, her eyes flashing with resolution.</p>

<p>"Try!" she cried once more in her clear, cheery
voice. "Don't give up yet. Try&mdash;<i>try hard</i>!"</p>

<p>One more desperate plunge and he had caught the
strong woolen fabric in both chilled, numb hands.
Could she tow him to shore? Would she have strength&mdash;that
frail, slight creature? She stepped slowly backward,
and with all her might pulled upon the impromptu
rope.</p>

<p>Moments passed, which seemed hours to Beatrix
Dane, but she did not give up. Her face was set and
pale, the little white teeth shut closely down upon
her under lip, her hands grasped the shawl with a
strength born of desperation.</p>

<p>And so at last the deed was done; the body of the
man&mdash;for he was quite unconscious now&mdash;was dragged
to shore, and Beatrix Dane stooped and gazed into
the still, white face. She fell back with a cry of astonishment.
It was the face of her dreams&mdash;her imaginary
hero, her fairy prince. His eyes were closed,
but there was the hair as black as midnight, the
straight, delicate features, the small, firm mouth, half
hidden by the silky black mustache, the graceful figure.
He was all that her fancy had painted; he was a facsimile
of the picture that had pleased her so.</p>

<p>She gazed upon the still, white face, and her heart
thrilled with a strange and unaccountable feeling; a
subtle happiness seemed to pervade her being.</p>

<p>"How handsome he is!" she exclaimed. "And oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
what can I do to restore him to consciousness? Poor
fellow! he will freeze."</p>

<p>The cold, chilly winds of November were straying
about through the bare, bleak country-side; they swept
over the drenched form lying upon the cold ground.
And Beatrix's heart grew chill as a horrible fear assailed
her that he would soon be frozen to death. His
clothing was literally freezing upon his body. Her
shawl, the only warm garment which she possessed,
was dripping with water; she wrung out its folds as
well as she could, and hung it upon a neighboring bush
to dry. Then she glanced around her; she must find
some way to warm him, or he would perish there before
her. Her eyes fell upon the package which lay
upon the ground near by; the package containing the
material for her new dress&mdash;the first new dress that
she had had in a whole year. The soft, warm folds
of merino would help to keep the life within his chilled
frame. There was no help for it, the dress must go.
Tearing open the wrapper, she drew forth the pretty
garnet merino, and not without a little pang, as she
remembered the rebuke which Mrs. Lynne would have
in store for her, she wound the warm folds about
his neck and chest.</p>

<p>Utterly unprotected herself, she stood shivering beside
the unconscious man, chafing his numb hands and
wrapping them in her skirts to try and restore the circulation.</p>

<p>The sun had long since set; night was coming
swiftly down. But she could not leave him to certain
death, even were it possible for her to cross the bridge
herself. A thought struck her; she ventured to slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
her hand timidly into the pocket of the young man's
coat. If she could find a few matches! Yes; how fortunate!
There, in a tiny metal safe impervious to the
water were plenty of lucifers. She heaped together a
quantity of brushwood and soon had lighted a fire. All
at once, she saw that the stranger's eyes were open
and fixed upon her face with a strange, questioning
expression&mdash;great dark eyes ideally beautiful. He
struggled to a sitting posture, his form trembling like
a leaf.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he faltered, feebly. "How
came I here? And you&mdash;who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Dane," the girl replied. "You fell
through the bridge, and I helped you out of the
water."</p>

<p>"You saved my life? Ah, yes! I remember now.
You are a brave girl. And, by Jove!"&mdash;as his glance
wandered to the slight, shivering figure&mdash;"you have
no wrap. What is this?" trying to start to his feet,
but falling back once more with an involuntary cry
of pain. "I&mdash;I fear that I am going to faint!" he murmured,
feebly. "Miss&mdash;Dane, will you please&mdash;look
in my coat-pocket for a flask&mdash;of&mdash;brandy?"</p>

<p>She obeyed him in silence, and fortunately found
a flask nearly filled with brandy. She forced him
gently to a seat which she had prepared of moss and
dry brushwood. Then, with deft fingers, she removed
the drinking-cup attached to the flask, and poured it
nearly full of the liquor. She held it to his lips, but
he motioned it away.</p>

<p>"You must drink some first," he said, in a tone
which she never once thought of disobeying. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
yes! you must! It may help to save your life. No
matter though you do not like it, you must drink it."</p>

<p>With a wry face the girl obeyed him, and drank
some of the fiery liquid, after which the stranger followed
her example. Then they crouched before the
fire to await the next move in the little romance.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then relief came. Two men
in a boat, rowing swiftly down the river, saw Beatrix
standing in the light of the brushwood fire. A few
vigorous pulls and the boat was landed, and the story
told. It did not take long to assist the stranger into
the boat, and Beatrix was safely seated in the stern
before it occurred to her that she had not inquired
his destination.</p>

<p>"I was on my way to Doctor Frederick Lynne's,"
the young man explained. "My name is Keith Kenyon,
and my home is in New Orleans."</p>

<p>Keith Kenyon! The name fell upon the girl's ears
like a strain of half-forgotten music. Her great dark
eyes met his with a startled glance of surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, you were going to my home!" she exclaimed.
"I am Doctor Lynne's adopted daughter&mdash;Beatrix
Dane."</p>

<p>As the words passed her lips their eyes met, and
a strange, subtle thrill went through Beatrix Dane's
heart at sight of the strange expression in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>But they had now reached the opposite shore,
where a team and light wagon were speedily procured,
and the kind-hearted men who were acting the
part of good Samaritans to the two so strangely
thrown together, drove them at once to Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Lynne's&mdash;the old, weather-beaten, unpainted house
where Beatrix Dane had passed her childhood and
youth, and where the strange romance of her young
life was destined to begin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.</p>


<p>"I wonder what keeps Beatrix so late? I am getting
very uneasy about her. It is after dark, and
snowing hard. I am very anxious, and besides I've
been thinking of the bridge over the river. I don't
believe from all accounts that it is half safe. Serena,
go to the door and see if she is coming."</p>

<p>Doctor Lynne had grown quite old and feeble in the
years that had elapsed since that night of mystery&mdash;that
momentous tenth of November. He leaned heavily
upon his cane, without which he could not walk at all,
and turned from the window where he had been stationed
for the last half hour.</p>

<p>Serena Lynne glanced up from the depths of the
big arm-chair where she sat absorbed in a novel, and
a frown disfigured her not very attractive face.</p>

<p>"Why do you bother so about Trix, papa?" she
asked, sharply. "The girl is able to take care of herself.
It is scarcely dark, and she will be home directly.
And she would go, you know, although mamma tried
her best to prevent her."</p>

<p>"Go to the door and see if she is coming," repeated
Frederick Lynne sternly. "Serena you are utterly devoid
of heart. Trix is ten years younger than you
and but a child. Poor little thing! if anything has
happened to her I shall never forgive myself for permitting
her to go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Serena Lynne laid her book aside with a gesture of
impatience, rising to her feet slowly and unwillingly.
A tall ungraceful young woman of some six or seven-and-twenty
with flaxen hair and pale blue eyes&mdash;not a
beauty by any means. And it was the sight of her
adopted sister's fair young beauty that made her invariably
ill-tempered and unkind to Beatrix. She
moved slowly and ungraciously to the door, and opened
it, making an unlovely picture as she walked, trailing
the folds of her slatternly blue serge wrapper over
the faded carpet, her feet thrust into a pair of ragged
slippers, her hair in an untidy little knot at the back
of her head. She wore no collar, none of the pretty
little devices which a neat woman always affects, but
a soiled white Shetland shawl was huddled about her
shoulders, and her sharp, peevish face, with its sallow
complexion and wide mouth, did not make a pretty or
lovable picture. For a time she stood peering out into
the darkness. At last:</p>

<p>"Papa!"&mdash;in a tone of suppressed excitement&mdash;"I
hear the sound of wheels. I think&mdash;I believe&mdash;yes, it
is a wagon, and it is stopping at the gate. There, I
suppose your pet Beatrix is home at last, and no harm
done."</p>

<p>Doctor Lynne hobbled slowly to the open door. His
wife, the personal counterpart of her daughter, glanced
up from the pile of mending with which she was occupying
herself, and a disagreeable expression settled
down upon her hard features.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven if she has really come at last!"
she ejaculated; "that girl is the curse of my life! I
only wish that we could get rid of her! I don't see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
how we are going to support her, now that the money
has ceased to come!"</p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>Doctor Lynne turned sharply upon his wife.</p>

<p>"I will hear no more of this!" he said, sternly.
"Beatrix Dane shall stay here as long as she sees fit.
Poor child! I imagine that she would not remain
long if she had her own way in the matter. Serena,"&mdash;making
his way to the door as swiftly as he was
able&mdash;"what is the matter?"</p>

<p>There was a slight bustle upon the broad veranda
outside, where a group of dark figures were outlined
against the blackness of the sky. A moment later and
Beatrix flashed into the room, pale and excited, her
eyes shining like stars.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! papa!"&mdash;kissing the old man's haggard
face. "Such a strange thing has happened! The river
bridge broke just as a gentleman was crossing on
horseback. He fell into the water, and I&mdash;I helped
him all I could, and he got out. And oh, papa, just
think! He was on his way to this house&mdash;to you. He
is outside."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, the two men made their appearance
in the doorway, leading between them the
faltering, swaying figure of the young man. Beatrix
hastily wheeled forward the easy-chair which Serena
had vacated, and the helpless man sank into its capacious
depths. Then the men who had brought Beatrix
and the stranger hither took their departure.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynne,"&mdash;Beatrix turned pleadingly to that
lady&mdash;"will you not do something for this gentleman?
He is suffering greatly. His name is Kenyon&mdash;Mr.
Keith Kenyon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Keith Kenyon</i>!" Mrs. Lynne started to her feet,
pale with surprise. "Why, so it is!" she cried, stooping
to peer into the face of the half-unconscious man.
"Keith! Keith! look up. Thank Heaven you are safe
with us! Serena, go and light a fire in the spare
chamber for your cousin Keith."</p>

<p>Beatrix started in surprise. During all the years
passed under that roof she had never before heard
of the existence of such a person.</p>

<p>"Your cousin?" she repeated, in a bewildered way,
as Serena left the room, in obedience to her mother's
directions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne's pale eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"To be sure. At least, he is not exactly a cousin,
only by adoption; which is all the better for Serena,
as I do not approve of the marriage of cousins."</p>

<p>A strange pang shot through Beatrix Dane's girlish
heart&mdash;a pang which was to her quite unaccountable.
Why should she care whom Keith Kenyon married?
Surely, it was nothing to her. Poor little Beatrix!
Although she did not dream the truth, the spell
of love was being woven about her young heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Out flew the web, and floated wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mirror cracked from side to side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The curse is come upon me!' cried<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The Lady of Shalott."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An hour later the young man was placed in bed in
the warm "spare chamber." Doctor Lynne having examined
his injuries, found them not as serious as had
been feared; and once attended to, Keith slept the sleep
of exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Twelve o'clock had struck before Beatrix retired
to her own bare little chamber, and seated herself before
the fire which she had ventured to kindle. No one
had thought of her, or given her the slightest attention;
Doctor Lynne, because he had been absorbed in
his patient to the exclusion of every other object; the
two women&mdash;mother and daughter&mdash;simply because
they did not care. Beatrix unfastened her beautiful
hair, and seating herself before the fire, wrapped a
worsted shawl about her shoulders. The door of her
room was pushed slowly open, and Serena appeared.</p>

<p>"Up yet?" she queried in a shrill, sharp voice.
"Well, I would like to ask you a few questions, Miss
Beatrix Dane. By the way, I wonder if your name
is&mdash;really Dane?"</p>

<p>A swift flush crimsoned the girl's pure cheek.</p>

<p>"We will not discuss that question tonight, Serena,"
she said, gently. "I am quite too tired and sleepy."</p>

<p>Serena came and stood before the fire, resting her
sallow cheek against the ugly wooden mantel.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about this thrilling adventure of
yours," she began, abruptly; "really, it is quite too romantic!"</p>

<p>In a few patient words Beatrix repeated all that
had occurred.</p>

<p>"I did not dream that Mr. Kenyon was a friend
of yours," she added, in conclusion.</p>

<p>Serena's pale eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Friend? He is more than a mere friend!" she
said, eagerly; "he is my cousin by adoption, and&mdash;and,
Beatrix, I have never told you before; but I expect
to be his wife some day!"</p>

<p>"<i>Impossible</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The word fell from Beatrix Dane's lips unawares.
In an instant she realized the mistake that she had
made.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon!" she faltered; "I did not
mean to offend you, Serena!"</p>

<p>"<i>Offend</i>?" Serena's thin lips parted in a disagreeable
smile. "<i>You</i> could not offend me if you tried;
not <i>you</i>&mdash;a nameless nobody!" she sneered. "And
whatever you may say or think in regard to the matter,
the truth remains&mdash;I am engaged to marry Keith
Kenyon. Are you satisfied? What else, do you
imagine, has brought him to this out-of-the-way place?
It seems that he telegraphed to papa that he was coming;
but the stupid idiots at the station neglected to
send the message out here. I shall be glad when I get
away from this hateful, dead-and-alive hole, and live in
a large city, in an elegant house, with everything that
heart can wish. Keith's home is in New Orleans, and
I have always felt a great desire to visit the South."</p>

<p>New Orleans! The name aroused Beatrix with a
little start. For the first time since her arrival home
she remembered the letter that had come from New
Orleans for Doctor Lynne. She searched hastily in the
pocket of her dress for the missive. Yes, it was there,
all safe.</p>

<p>"I must see papa at once," she observed, rising to
her feet.</p>

<p>"<i>Papa</i>, indeed!" mimicked Serena, contemptuously.
"If I were you I would wait until I could prove my
right to call any one by that name before I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Hush</i>! Not another word! I will hear no more
of your insolence. Leave my room, Serena Lynne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and never enter it again until you can treat me with
proper respect."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! Good gracious! what next? How
we <i>do</i> put on airs! For my part&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well. If you will not vacate, I shall leave
the room myself," cried Beatrix, too indignant to endure
any more. She was faint and exhausted from
fatigue and the exposures of the night. No one had
offered her even a cup of tea or the slightest refreshment
after her adventure in the cold night air, chilled
and half clothed as she had been; and she was not
enough at home in the house, where she had lived
for sixteen years, to venture to suggest her need of
refreshment. She flashed swiftly past the discomfited
Serena, and down the bare stairs to Doctor Lynne's
large cheerful sleeping apartment. Mrs. Lynne was
still with the patient, and peeping in at the open door
of Doctor Lynne's room, Beatrix was so fortunate as
to find him there alone.</p>

<p>"Papa!"&mdash;hesitatingly&mdash;"may I speak with you?"</p>

<p>Frederick Lynne glanced up, and a glad light
flashed over his worn countenance.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear!" he returned. "Come in.
Why, Beatrix, child!"&mdash;with a startled glance into her
white face&mdash;"you are ill, exhausted. How thoughtless
and selfish in me not to think of you before. Here,
drink a glass of wine!"</p>

<p>He filled a glass from the decanter of home-made
wine upon the table, and held it to her lips. Beatrix
drained the contents of the glass; then she sank
wearily into the empty chair at his side.</p>

<p>"Papa, do you know anything concerning my parents&mdash;my
real parents?" she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>His face grew pale.</p>

<p>"No, dear; you have heard all that I know in regard
to your history. Do not trouble yourself, Beatrix;
it will all come right some time, I am sure. Try
to have faith that all is for the best."</p>

<p>"I wish I could. I am tired of this life&mdash;tired of
living here with Mrs. Lynne and Serena. I shall be
glad to go out into the world and earn my own living.
Don't look so horrified, daddy, darling. And
by the way, I nearly forgot my errand here to you.
I have a letter for you."</p>

<p>She drew the letter from her pocket and laid it in
his hand.</p>

<p>At sight of the superscription his face grew pale as
death. Breaking the seal with a trembling hand, he
drew forth two inclosures&mdash;two separate letters.</p>

<p>"Go, my dear," he said, gently; "it is late, and
you must retire now. Besides, I would rather be
alone. Kiss me good-night, Beatrix, my little comfort."</p>

<p>She stooped, and putting her white arms about his
neck, laid her warm, red lips upon his.</p>

<p>"Good-night, papa, darling," she whispered.</p>

<p>At the door of the room she paused and looked
back. He was sitting in a dejected attitude, his white
head resting upon one hand; the other held the letters.</p>

<p>She went slowly and thoughtfully upstairs back to
her own room, and, retiring, was soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>She was aroused from slumber by a shrill shriek
which resounded through the silent house. Starting
to her feet, Beatrix threw on a loose wrapper, and
thrusting her bare feet into a pair of slippers, left the
room and flew swiftly down-stairs. She made her way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
instinctively to Doctor Lynne's room. He was seated
in his arm-chair before the fire, just as she had left
him, while his wife, whose cry of horror had aroused
the house, stood near, pale and terrified. One of the
letters which he had received had been destroyed by
fire&mdash;only a heap of smoke-blackened fragments upon
the hearth remained to tell the tale; but one hand
clutched the other letter in a convulsive grasp, as he
sat there, white, and still, and dead. Death had stolen
in like a thief in the night, and he was gone forever.</p>

<p>The letter which that cold, stiff hand clutched tenaciously,
was found to contain these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doctor Lynne</span>,&mdash;The time has come for you to
know the truth concerning the child of your adoption,
Beatrix Dane. The accompanying letter contains
a full explanation. When you have read it, you
will see that it is best for you to send her to me now.
Let her come to New Orleans, to the inclosed address,
as soon as possible. You will receive a remittance for
all her necessary expenses, by registered mail, in a few
days. When that arrives, send Beatrix Dane to me.
The time has come when she must learn the hideous
secret connected with her birth&mdash;when she must face
her own future, and enter upon her heritage of woe.</p>

<p class="sig2">
"<span class="smcap">Bernard Dane</span>."<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A MAD PASSION.</p>


<p>Cold and still in death, Frederick Lynne sat in his
big arm-chair, one icy hand clutching the letter which
bade Beatrix face an unknown and dreaded future&mdash;face
it all alone. Mrs. Lynne stood near, crying aloud
in terrified accents for help, for succor, her face as
white as the dead man's, when Beatrix entered the
room. One swift glance, which did not comprehend
the situation&mdash;for poor Beatrix knew nothing of the
horrors of death, and had never faced it before&mdash;one
swift, terrified glance, and she flew to the dead man's
side.</p>

<p>"Papa! oh, papa!" she cried in an agonized voice,
"what is the matter, dear? Are you ill? Are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Hush</i>!" Mrs. Lynne's bony hand came down upon
the girl's arm with emphasis. "Be quiet, you baby!"
she panted. "Can't you see that he is&mdash;is <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>The girl fell back as though the heavy hand had
struck her a blow; her great dark eyes dilated with
horror; the small hands clinched each other spasmodically;
her breath came and went in short, panting;
gasps. Could it be true? Was this grim death before
her? Was the kindly heart&mdash;the heart of her only
friend&mdash;cold and still forever? It could not&mdash;could
not be!</p>

<p>"Dead?" she repeated, blankly, her lips quivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
over the awful word&mdash;"dead? Oh, no, Mrs. Lynne!
surely you are mistaken! Let us try to do something
for him. I will call Serena to stay with you,
and I will go for help. I can ride the gentleman's
horse&mdash;Mr. Kenyon's&mdash;it is here, you know. I will
go over to town and get Doctor Stone."</p>

<p>"Humph! You can not. The bridge is gone; and,
besides it is utterly useless. I have seen death too
many times, Beatrix Dane, to be mistaken. I tell you
he is dead and has been for hours; he is quite cold.
See!"</p>

<p>With a slow, reluctant movement Beatrix ventured
to lay her trembling fingers upon the cold, rigid hand
of the corpse. She drew back with a low cry of terror.</p>

<p>"Oh! how cold&mdash;how cold!" she moaned. "Oh,
papa! papa! papa! cold and dead! It is true&mdash;it is
indeed true. Oh, Mrs. Lynne! what shall we do without
him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne's thin lip curled.</p>

<p>"What will I do, you mean?" she retorted. "It can
have no effect upon you. See! that letter in his hand
is a message for you. You are to go away at once
to your own home, thank goodness!"</p>

<p>The great brown velvety eyes met the cold orbs before
her with a stare of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Go home&mdash;to&mdash;my&mdash;own home, Mrs. Lynne?" she
repeated, blankly. "Why, I have no home but this!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! And pray, who gave you a right to call
this home? Such as it is, it is the only shelter that
you have had for sixteen years. You ought to be ready
to leave it now. You are nearly seventeen years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and able to take care of yourself. Ah! there is Serena
at last!" as a limp figure made its appearance in
the open door&mdash;a tall, ungraceful figure in a calico
wrapper, and muffled in a huge woolen shawl.</p>

<p>"<i>Mamma</i>"&mdash;in a tone of consternation&mdash;"what has
happened? What is the matter with papa? Is he ill?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne wound her arms around the angular
form of her daughter, and burst into tears&mdash;the first
real emotion which she had ever betrayed before Beatrix.</p>

<p>"He is <i>dead</i>, Serena!" she faltered&mdash;"dead and
gone! And Heaven only knows what is to become
of you and me! Not even sufficient means in the
house to defray the funeral expenses; and, of course,
with his death, the small pension which he received
from his professional brethren of the Medical Club
expires also. Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear! it was an unfortunate
day when I married Fred Lynne and tied
myself down to poverty!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, that was long enough ago for you to
forget it now," interposed her dutiful daughter. "Mamma"&mdash;putting
away her mother's arms from about her
neck&mdash;"whatever you do, don't be foolish. Have you
tried to restore him? He may not be dead, after all."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> dead. I have done everything that I possibly
could before I called any one. When I found all my
efforts useless, I gave up in despair, and I screamed
so loudly that it awoke Beatrix, and she came to the
room."</p>

<p>"<i>Beatrix</i>! Ah!"&mdash;with a swift glance of malice
into the girl's white face&mdash;"and so <i>she</i> heard you?
She is always sneaking around where she is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
wanted. Mamma, have you&mdash;have you read that letter?"
pointing to the crumpled sheet of paper which
Mrs. Lynne had with great difficulty succeeded in removing
from the cold hand of the dead man.</p>

<p>"Yes. It contains the very best news imaginable.
It is a letter from that girl's people sending for her
at last."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Why, I did not believe that she had
any people. But&mdash;there is another letter upon the
hearth. See! it is burned. I believe papa destroyed it
as soon as he read it, for some purpose of his own.
How very exasperating!"</p>

<p>Serena was on her knees now upon the hearth,
eagerly but carefully turning over the blackened sheet
of paper which had been torn in four pieces and cast
upon the fire. But the fire was at its last gasp when
the deed was done, and the paper had not burned&mdash;only
blackened and scorched until the contents of the
letter were perfectly undecipherable. Serena examined
the written sheet attentively, and her face grew dark
with intense disappointment.</p>

<p>"How provoking!" she muttered, savagely. "There
was, no doubt, something of importance in that letter.
I believe in my heart that the news it contained has
killed my father. Yet he has destroyed the letter, and
there is nothing left to tell the tale."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and glanced furtively around.
Beatrix had thrown herself upon the faded sofa, and
was sobbing softly, her face hid in her hands. Mrs.
Lynne was beginning to make some attempt at arranging
the poor body&mdash;an attempt which must be made
alone since they were so isolated from neighbors. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
one observed Serena's movements. Her eyes glittered
with a curious, brassy light. With a swift, gliding
movement, she hastened to an old-fashioned cabinet
which stood in a corner of the room, and opening it,
removed an empty tin box from a shelf. With hands
that trembled a little in spite of her efforts to control
herself, she carried the box over to the fireplace,
and going down upon her knees once more, she
lifted the fragments of the smoke-blackened letter and
placed them as carefully within the box as though that
letter had been worth many times its weight in gold.
And so it was. A thousand times over, as Serena
Lynne was destined to discover some future day. Securing
the lid upon the box, she rose softly, and hastened
away upstairs to her own room. Once there, she
hid the tin box in her trunk, and locked it carefully.
Then, with an inscrutable expression upon her pale,
cold face, she glided swiftly down the stairs once
more.</p>

<p>On her way back to the apartment where her dead
father lay, she paused at the door of Keith Kenyon's
room. It was standing ajar, and she ventured to steal
inside. He was sleeping heavily under the influence
of the strong opiate which Doctor Lynne had given
him. Serena stood gazing at the sleeper, her plain face
all aglow with rapture, her pale eyes gleaming with a
look of devouring love and passionate adoration.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love! my love!" she murmured, softly. "I
would lay my life down for your dear sake! I would
die a thousand deaths&mdash;I would suffer martyrdom to
win your heart! Oh, Keith! Keith! my hero, my only
love! whom I have loved all my life, ever since my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
childhood's days, when you were with us; and I have
never forgotten you&mdash;never ceased to care. Your little
sweetheart, you called me then; and you used to tell
me that some day, when we were man and woman
grown, I should be your wife. And so I shall! You
shall call no other woman wife! Oh, Keith! if you do
not love me I shall die&mdash;I shall die!"</p>

<p>The sleeper moved uneasily upon the pillow, and
the beautiful lips parted slightly, while, low and
sweet, but clear and distinct to the ears of the listener,
came the one muttered word:</p>

<p>"<i>Beatrix</i>!"</p>

<p>It was enough to arouse the slumbering devil in the
woman's breast. She started as though she had been
shot. A moan of bitter anguish passed her lips, and
fell upon the dead silence of the sick-room. She turned
blindly, like one groping in the dark, and fled back to
the death-chamber.</p>

<p>Her mother glanced up from her grewsome work
as Serena entered, and her ghastly face and flashing
eyes made the mother start with a strange alarm and
terror.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried, wildly. "What else has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Where is that girl?" demanded Serena, glancing
wildly around the room.</p>

<p>"She has gone for assistance," returned Mrs. Lynne,
slowly. "Some one <i>must</i> be found to come to my aid
tonight, and Beatrix offered to go. She said that
Keith's horse had been brought here by the men who
drove them home, and she would ride it over to Burtonville,
to the Rogerses. Some of them will come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
immediately, I know. Serena, in Heaven's name, what
<i>is</i> the matter? You look as if you had seen a ghost!"</p>

<p>"So I have&mdash;so I have!" sobbed Serena, bitterly.
"I have seen the ghost of my dead love&mdash;my broken
life! Listen, mamma. Unless you get rid of that
girl Beatrix Dane&mdash;or whatever her right name may
be&mdash;my happiness will be ruined forever. Mamma!
mamma! I have reason to believe that Keith is falling
in love with her already!"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i>? You are mad, Serena!"</p>

<p>"I am not. I wish I were. He is muttering her
name over and over in his sleep even now. She saved
his life, you know; and that, of all things, would serve
to attract and draw them together from the first. Mamma,
I tell you I am lost&mdash;lost! I love him! I love
him! I do not deny it, and if I can not win his love
and be his wife, I shall die!"</p>

<p>"Hush! Be quiet. Control yourself. You <i>shall</i> be
his wife. We will keep Beatrix away from him, and
in a few days, when her money comes, she shall be
packed off to New Orleans, and good-bye forever to
Miss Beatrix Dane. And before Keith leaves this place
to return to his home he must make you his wife. We
will try to bring that about, Serena. It <i>must</i> be done!"</p>

<p>"It <i>shall</i> be! He <i>shall</i> care for me!" repeated the
heartless girl. "Here, by the side of my dead father,
I swear that I&mdash;and I alone&mdash;shall be Keith Kenyon's
wife!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ON THE EVE OF DEPARTURE.</p>


<p>Out in the cold starry night Beatrix was riding
swiftly on to the little town of Burtonville&mdash;a small
settlement which lay some three miles beyond the
home of the Lynnes. It was isolated from the railroad,
and was in fact only a handful of houses dropped
down in the midst of the woods for no apparent purpose
whatever.</p>

<p>The wind blew shrill and cold, but the girl had
wrapped herself warmly and did not mind it as she
galloped on in the face of the blast. She had only
one thought to occupy her&mdash;the good old man whom
she had loved as a father, was dead. Never more would
she hear his kindly voice, never more would she listen
to his gentle words. She thought of the parting that
night, and her heart thrilled with thankfulness that
she had come back to kiss him and bid him good-night.</p>

<p>"For the last time," she murmured, sadly; "the
very last time&mdash;poor papa!"</p>

<p>On she went, until the three miles were covered, and
she drew rein before a tiny brown cottage, where dwelt
their kind friends, the Rogerses. Dismounting, she
rapped loudly at the outer door. Her summons aroused
the inmates, and in a few moments her sad story was
told. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rogers hastily prepared
themselves to return with Beatrix to the desolate home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the Lynnes; and so in the course of an hour they
entered the weather-beaten old house upon whose portals
death had left its dreadful sign.</p>

<p>Once inside, and satisfied that Mrs. Lynne would be
relieved from further cares, Beatrix made her way
slowly, falteringly, up to her own chamber, and once
there, fainted quietly away for the first time in her
life. The natural reaction to all the excitement of
the day had come, and the girl's strength could endure
no more. A little later, Serena, passing the open door,
saw Beatrix lying upon the floor where she had fallen.
She came swiftly to her side and gazed into the pale
little face with eyes full of hatred.</p>

<p>"I wish she was dead!" hissed the woman, bleakly.
"I wish to Heaven she would never recover from this
swoon, never open her eyes to the world again. I
hate her. I can not help it. She will steal him from
me&mdash;the only man for whom I shall ever care. Keith
might have learned to love me in time; but, of course,
a face like hers is certain to win the prize. I am plain&mdash;I
know it&mdash;and I can not deny that Beatrix is lovely.
But I would have been a good wife to Keith; I would
lay my life down for him; I would be willing to be his
slave if only he would love me. Oh, Keith! Keith!
Heart of my heart, soul of my soul!" She turned away,
wringing her hands frantically. "If I can not win you,
it would be better for me to die!"</p>

<p>She left the unconscious girl alone, and calling Mrs.
Rogers, sent her to Beatrix's assistance. It was hours
before the poor girl was fully restored. She looked
like a snow-wreath as she moved silently about the
house, in the plain black gown which had been provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for her. She was pale and wan, and her great
dark eyes looked unnaturally bright, and shone like
stars.</p>

<p>Two days later the funeral took place, and Frederick
Lynne was buried away out of sight in the bare,
bleak little grave-yard, over which the first snow lay
soft and warm like a blanket. The day after the funeral,
Mr. Rogers, driving over from the post-office
(the bridge having been repaired), paused at the
dreary home of the Lynnes with a registered letter
addressed to its late master.</p>

<p>"I took the liberty of signing for it," he said, as he
placed the letter in Mrs. Lynne's outstretched hand.
And then, with a kindly inquiry for Keith Kenyon,
and a cheerful good-morning, he took his departure.
Without a moment's delay, Mrs. Lynne tore open the
letter with eager haste. A crisp five-hundred dollar
bill dropped from between the folded pages. She
picked it up with a gasp of delight, and just at that
moment Beatrix entered the room. There was no help
for it. Mrs. Lynne knew that the letter and its inclosure
must be at once turned over to the girl. She
placed it in her hand.</p>

<p>"There! That is yours, I suppose," she said, ungraciously.</p>

<p>With dilated eyes Beatrix read the words addressed
to Frederick Lynne:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doctor Lynne</span>," so ran the letter,&mdash;"I send inclosed
five hundred dollars per registered mail, the
most convenient way of forwarding remittances, since
you are residing in a place destitute of banks and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
conveniences. Send Beatrix Dane to New Orleans
immediately&mdash;to No. &mdash;&mdash; St. Charles Avenue, and
oblige,</p>

<p class="sig1">
"Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="sig2">
"<span class="smcap">Bernard Dane</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Beatrix lifted her eyes, and they met the cold gaze
of Mrs. Lynne.</p>

<p>"How much will my ticket cost?" she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne made no reply.</p>

<p>"Will you please get the money changed?" persisted
Beatrix, gently, laying the bill in the woman's
hand. "I will take one hundred dollars; the rest is
yours."</p>

<p>A swift gleam passed over the hard countenance.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" she cried.</p>

<p>Beatrix's red lip curled scornfully.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I have been an expense to you ever
since the remittances failed to come. And now, Mrs.
Lynne, I suppose I had better prepare at once for my
journey."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne did not attempt to dissuade her. The
simple preparations were soon completed, and it was
arranged that Beatrix should start on the early train
the next morning.</p>

<p>Late in the day, as Beatrix was passing the open
door of the sick-room, she heard her name called in
a low, eager tone. She paused hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Come in, will you not?" Keith Kenyon asked,
softly. She came swiftly to the bedside.</p>

<p>"I hope you are feeling better," she ventured, timidly;
for this was the first time she had seen him since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the accident. His beautiful eyes lighted up with a tender
light. He took her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Why have you not come to see me?" he asked in
a low tone. "I have begged Serena and Aunt Lynne
to ask you to come for a moment. I have something to
say to you&mdash;such a strange thing to tell you, Miss
Dane; it seems like a romance, this that I have to say.
But first let me thank you for saving my life."</p>

<p>Her face flushed, and then grew pale.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing," she faltered. "I only
wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, and for a brief moment their eyes met.
A sweet, nameless thrill passed from heart to heart.
He laid her little hand against his lips.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he was beginning, passionately. But
the words died upon his lips, checked abruptly; for
there in the open door stood Mrs. Lynne, pale with
wrath, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"<i>Beatrix</i>!" she panted, wrathfully. "Good gracious
girl, what are you doing here? This is no place
for you. How improper! how <i>very</i> improper and unmaidenly!"</p>

<p>Blushing like a rose with mortification, poor Beatrix
fled swiftly from the room. And little did she
dream of the strange announcement which had been
upon the lips of Keith Kenyon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne followed the girl to her own room, and
once there, closed its door behind her.</p>

<p>"You bold-faced creature!" she panted, angrily,
"How dared you enter Keith Kenyon's room alone?
You are utterly shameless!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful eyes met the fiery orbs before her
with brave frankness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenyon called me; he had something to tell
me, he said," she returned, quietly, "and I could not
refuse to see him. I have not seen him before since
the accident."</p>

<p>"And I will take care that you shall not see him
again!" hissed the woman, fiercely. "Such conduct
is terrible! It is positively shocking for an unmarried
woman&mdash;a mere girl&mdash;to enter a man's sick-room!"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes flashed ominously.</p>

<p>"If it is improper for me, Mrs. Lynne," she returned
coldly, "it must be the same for Serena. She is not
married, although she is rather an old girl," she added,
naïvely.</p>

<p>"You wretch!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne was almost speechless with wrath.</p>

<p>"How <i>dare</i> you?" she hissed, bringing her hand
down upon the girl's shrinking shoulder with savage
emphasis&mdash;"how <i>dare</i> you call Serena old?"</p>

<p>"She is nearly twenty-seven," returned Beatrix,
coolly. "Not old, to be sure, but certainly old enough
to know how to behave herself. I think that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Hush</i>! Not another word, or I will strike you!"</p>

<p>"You shall not!"</p>

<p>Beatrix faced the termagant before her with a
white, resolute face, and a look in the depths of her
dark eyes which made Mrs. Lynne quail.</p>

<p>"As I intend going over to the village tonight," said
Beatrix, quietly, "that I may be in time for the train
in the morning, I may as well bid you good-bye. I think
that you will be sorry some day for the way that you
have treated me, Mrs. Lynne."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>She closed the door behind the retreating figure of
her tormentor, and made ready for the journey. A little
later she came down the stairs, attired in a traveling-dress,
her only baggage a small hand-bag. Everything
was as still as death. She stole softly to the door of
the room where Keith Kenyon lay upon his sick-bed.
The door was closed; she paused and laid her hot
cheek against the cold, hard panel of the door, her sore
heart swelling with bitter resentment.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she whispered, softly. "I shall never
see you again&mdash;my friend that might have been. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Never see him again? Yet how can Beatrix Dane
know that? In the long, dark days before her, how
can she tell what the strange chances in life's lottery
may bring her? It is well that she does not know. How
many of us, knowing the future, would shrink from
the ordeal before us, and pray for the boon of death!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HER OATH.</p>


<p>In a spacious chamber of a great, gloomy mansion,
an old man sat alone, his gray head bowed upon
his trembling hands, which rested upon a cane. A few
blocks away the hum and traffic of the Crescent City
filled the air; but here all was still and quiet. An up-town
mansion, embowered in huge live-oaks&mdash;a shady,
silent place, the sight of which made one feel gloomy,
and caused a slight chill to pass involuntarily over the
frame. The great house looked like an enchanted palace,
with old Bernard Dane the presiding genii, all
alone and lonely like the last leaf upon the tree.</p>

<p>The moments came and went, and still he sat there
silent and alone; once in awhile a few muttered words
would pass his grim lips, and the wrinkled hands upon
the cane-head would clinch each other savagely. At
last he lifted his head, and turning slowly in his arm-chair,
pressed the electric button in the wall at his side.
A moment later, an obsequious servant entered&mdash;a
black servitor in the Dane family for years.</p>

<p>"Any news, Simons?" asked Bernard Dane, eagerly.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sah; nothing&mdash;nothing 'tall, sah&mdash;not yet. We
only got de tellygram from Marse Ken sayin' dat he
done arrive safe&mdash;dat's all, sah. Kin I do anything
for you, Marse Bernard?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; nothing. Of course not. I want nothing
in the wide world but to see that boy back again, with
his errand done as I directed him. It was a wise
thought of mine&mdash;a wise thought to send him. Ha! ha!
Throw two young fools together, under the circumstances,
and they'll fall in love with each other as
sure as they live! <i>Love</i>? Bah! if <i>I</i> had my way, that
word should be stricken from the lexicon. It is the
cause of all the trouble, all the sin, all the sorrow in
the world&mdash;<i>Con</i>found it, Simons! are you there yet?
Do I employ you to stand listening to me in this way?
Do I? Answer me, sir!"</p>

<p>"No, sah&mdash;no, sah; in course not," stammered
Simons, in confusion. "I beg pardon, sah; but, you
see, Marse Bernard, I&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Thought</i>! Never think, Simons. Don't let me ever
hear again that you indulge in the pernicious habit of
<i>thinking</i>! Great Heaven! what would <i>I</i> not give to
drown thought&mdash;to bury it out of sight&mdash;deep, deep&mdash;so
deep that nothing on earth would ever have the
power to resurrect it! <i>Thought&mdash;memory</i>! Bah! a
regular Old Man of the Sea&mdash;like that story of Anstey's,
'The Fallen Idol.' (Deuced clever fellow is Anstey!)
Some artist fellow owned the idol, and he
could not get rid of the thing, no matter what he did.
He hid it&mdash;gave it away&mdash;lost it&mdash;drowned it&mdash;buried
it&mdash;left no stone unturned to be rid of its cursed presence.
It was ruining his life, and making him contemplate
suicide. But all his efforts were in vain. Even
theosophy itself was of no avail&mdash;and, to my way of
thinking, theosophy can do much. And so the poor
fellow was cursed by the presence of this idol&mdash;a black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
evil shadow upon his life&mdash;until a bolt of thunder and
a flash of lightning shivered the thing to fragments.
Direct interposition of Providence! Ah, yes; to be
sure&mdash;Simons!"&mdash;flashing about swiftly, as his eyes
fell upon the unfortunate darky&mdash;"what on earth are
you doing here? Didn't I tell you to go?"</p>

<p>"No, sah; I never heard you, sah!"</p>

<p>"Then hear me now&mdash;<i>Go</i>!"</p>

<p>And the heavy cane came down upon the floor with
emphasis.</p>

<p>Outside, a night of storm and tempest. The roar
of the wind, the beating rain, or roar of the elements,
which, after all, is no more fierce and bitter than that
which often rages within a human breast. The wind
shrieked shrilly down the chimney, the trees swayed in
the blast, and tapped upon the crystal window-panes
with bare, ghostly fingers. Old Bernard Dane drew
a little nearer the fire, and wrapped his silken dressing-gown
about his gaunt frame.</p>

<p>"What o'clock is it?" he demanded, as Simons was
about to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Jes' nine, sah. De church clock jes' struck."</p>

<p>"Humph! Very well; do go. No&mdash;stop! was not
that the gate bell? Can it be Ken at last? Wish to
mercy it may be. Go and see who has come, Simons,
and make haste!"</p>

<p>The negro obeyed in silence, and the door closed
behind him.</p>

<p>Bernard Dane's head drooped once more upon his
clasped hands, and save for his slow, labored breathing,
there was no sound to break the dreary silence of the
room. The moments came and went until five&mdash;twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
five&mdash;three times five&mdash;were ticked away. Then the
chamber door opened noiselessly, so noiselessly that
Bernard Dane did not hear it, and a slight, black-robed
figure stole softly into the room and stood beside the
hearth. A forlorn little figure in an old-fashioned,
dingy black gown, with a dowdyish hat pushed back
from the pale little face, with its tired, drooping mouth,
and great, glorious dark eyes full of a weary light.</p>

<p>"I am Beatrix Dane," said a soft voice, timidly.</p>

<p>The old man lifted his head, and his eyes fell upon
the face before him. A strange change passed over his
stern features, a look of slow horror froze his face
down like an icy mask. He arose to his feet, tall,
gaunt, grim; but in the presence of this slip of a girl,
he was trembling as though he was afraid.</p>

<p>"Powers above!" he panted, brokenly. "When did
you arrive? Where is&mdash;is&mdash;Surely you did not travel
all this distance alone!"&mdash;his voice trembling with an
inflection of surprise which was almost terror.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I came alone. There was no help for it.
Oh, Mr. Dane, I have such dreadful news to tell you!
Papa is dead; he died of heart disease while he was
reading your last letters to him!"</p>

<p>"Papa!"&mdash;the scornful intonation in Bernard Dane's
voice was a revelation. "Papa, indeed! Ha! ha! <i>You</i>
have no father. No, I do not mean that you are not
legitimate, but it is worse than that. <i>You</i>, upon whom
the curse of God has fallen, can have no claim of near
kinship with any one. It would be a fine thing to be
the father of a creature like&mdash;like&mdash;Girl, do you know
that you are accursed? That you have a destiny to fulfill,
the very thought of which makes my heart stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
still with horror? You have a dark inheritance in store,
and may Heaven give you strength to bear your burden,
for 'vain is the help of men.'</p>

<p>"No, I am not insane; there is no insanity in the
Dane family. I am not idiotic; I am as sane and
sound as you are, and more than you will be when
you learn the truth concerning yourself. Don't shrink
away and cower out of sight like that. Be a woman.
Do you know what that means? It means to bear the
burden of another's sin; to carry its consequences
about in your heart&mdash;your tender, guiltless, woman's
heart&mdash;until your life is darkened and ruined forever.
It means to suffer in secret and silence, and to lie down
and die, sooner than see the one punished for whom
you suffer. <i>This</i> is to be a woman. There! I have no
more to say tonight&mdash;No&mdash;wait a moment before you
go to your own room which I have had prepared for
you. Come here, and let me look at you. Yes, to be
sure, you are fair. I thought that you would be. You
are beautiful, indeed. Oh, heavens! what a fate&mdash;what
a fate for one so young and fair! Now, Beatrix
Dane, answer me: have you come here prepared to render
strict obedience to my wishes? You do not know
what right I have to direct you? Ah! so I thought.
Well, you may call me uncle&mdash;Uncle Bernard. The first
relative you have ever known? <i>Humph</i>. Well, pray
Heaven it may be the last. Now, listen while I tell you
why I have sent for you at this late day."</p>

<p>She came a little nearer and lifted her piteous, pleading
eyes to his stern face.</p>

<p>"Uncle&mdash;Uncle Bernard," she faltered, timidly,
"please don't speak such wild, harsh words to me tonight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Let me hear you say something kind. Remember,
I have no one in the wide world but you. I promise
to be good and obedient. I promise to obey you
like a slave; to do anything you say. No one has ever
loved me. Won't you try to love me a little&mdash;only a
little? I promise to do whatever you may wish me to
do."</p>

<p>"You promise?"</p>

<p>His wrinkled face lighted up with a swift gleam
of triumph.</p>

<p>"<i>Swear</i> to do as I wish!" he panted, desperately. "I
demand that you do so. Swear to obey me implicitly,
Beatrix Dane."</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes drooped for an instant. Surely
he would exact no promise of her beyond her power
to fulfill? Could a man&mdash;an old man&mdash;be so hard
upon a poor, weak, timid creature&mdash;utterly defenseless&mdash;like
herself? For she had yet to learn, poor ignorant
child, that with some men "<i>might</i> makes right."</p>

<p>"I swear it, Uncle Bernard!" she said, slowly.
"Now, kiss me, and say that you will love me a little!"</p>

<p>And she ventured to lay one small hand timidly upon
his arm. With a hoarse, inarticulate cry he struck
the little hand aside and started to his feet.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" he panted, wildly; "don't <i>dare</i>
to touch me! <i>Kiss</i> you? I would sooner cut my own
throat. Get away&mdash;away&mdash;out of my sight! Do you
hear? No! Wait until I have told you what I wish
you to do, and remember, Beatrix Dane, you have
<i>sworn</i> to obey me. I have sent for you for a particular
object; for that object I have had you reared and educated.
The time has come to carry out my plan; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
is this: I have sent for you, Beatrix Dane, to marry
the man whom I have chosen for you&mdash;the son of my
adoption. You must become his wife at the time I
have appointed, or&mdash;you will wish that you had never
been born!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BETROTHED.</p>


<p>The days came and went with slow, monotonous
round in the old brown, weather-beaten house where
Keith Kenyon lay ill unto death. Mrs. Lynne scarcely
left his bedside. She was a skillful nurse, and in this
case she felt more than an ordinary interest, for she
had come to look upon Keith as a prospective son-in-law.
When he was a child&mdash;a little fatherless, motherless
babe&mdash;he had been placed in care of Mrs. Lynne's
sister to be reared. It was after he had grown to be
a youth of fifteen that he had been formally adopted
by an old man in New Orleans, of whose name Mrs.
Lynne and Serena were both ignorant; they had only
heard of the mere fact of his adoption. The years had
come and gone, and although he wrote occasionally to
Mrs. Lynne, and always inclosed a kindly message and
sometimes a few written lines to Serena, he had never
confided absolutely in them, and they had refrained
from asking questions. Year after year he had written
that he hoped to find an opportunity to visit his
old friends; but heretofore he had found it impossible
to keep his promise.</p>

<p>There is a certain place, unmentionable to ears polite,
which is popularly believed to be paved with good
intentions. Keith Kenyon had evidently laid a block or
two of this pavement; at all events, his intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
though good, had come to naught. And now, just when
the mother and daughter had given up all hope of ever
seeing him again, he had suddenly appeared at their
home. For all these years&mdash;the long, long time since
their last meeting&mdash;years during which Keith Kenyon
had not given many thoughts to Serena, and even
then only thinking of her as his childish playmate, she
had thought of him with a steady and unwavering interest
and a fixed intention to some day become his
wife.</p>

<p>The news of his adoption by a wealthy old man had
not lessened her interest in Keith or her resolution
to marry him. He would be rich some day. She was
tired of the weary battle with poverty, and longed, with
all her mercenary heart and narrow soul, to enjoy the
advantages of wealth and position. And as the years
went by, her purpose grew with them; she had but one
object in life&mdash;to marry Keith Kenyon and share his
fortune. Yet now that she had met him at last, her
love for him had grown to such great proportions, that,
even had he not been the rich man's heir in prospective,
she would have been willing to marry him had he
chosen her to be his wife. But fate had decreed that
he should choose otherwise.</p>

<p>After Doctor Lynne's burial, Keith grew rapidly
worse, and was soon in a raging fever, with small
hopes of recovery.</p>

<p>Doctor Stone, the village physician, called every day
to see the patient, and his wrinkled face grew graver
and graver as he marked the alarming symptoms.</p>

<p>"I fear for the worst," he said to Mrs. Lynne at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>And then into that astute lady's heart a swift inspiration
rushed like a flood. Her eyes wore a look
of resolution, and she shut her thin lips grimly together
as she hissed, sharply:</p>

<p>"He shall make Serena his wife before he dies! She
shall be his wife; and then she will be able to claim a
portion of the fortune. It shall be so!"</p>

<p>She was passing the open door of the sick-room one
day, when she was startled by hearing Keith's voice,
weak and tremulous, calling her name.</p>

<p>She came to a halt, her face pale with surprise, for
he had not spoken for several days, only the wild
ravings of delirium.</p>

<p>"What is it, Keith?" she asked, going swiftly to the
bedside.</p>

<p>His great dark eyes were lifted to her face with
a wistful look in their depths.</p>

<p>"Beatrix!" he faltered, feebly. "I want Beatrix.
Where is she?"</p>

<p>A look of fiendish hatred flashed into Mrs. Lynne's
pale eyes, and the bony hands clutched each other
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Beatrix is not here," she replied.</p>

<p>He started up wildly; then fell back upon the pillows,
faint and exhausted.</p>

<p>"Not here?" he repeated, brokenly. "Oh, Mrs.
Lynne! don't tell me that she is gone! Why, she
could not go all alone; and he&mdash;he sent me here for
her."</p>

<p>"Sent you for her? Who sent you?" demanded
Mrs. Lynne sharply.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard. That was my business here in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
place. He said that Beatrix was to come home to New
Orleans to him, and so he sent me to escort her there.
Tell me&mdash;where is she? Tell her to come to me. I
want Beatrix&mdash;I want Beatrix!"</p>

<p>"You will never get her!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne's breath was coming thick and fast; her
pale eyes scintillated; her hands were clinching each
other convulsively.</p>

<p>"You will never see Beatrix Dane again," she
panted. "Shall I tell you why? She has left us forever&mdash;gone
away to be married. She is married by
this time. She went away, leaving you lying here upon
this sick-bed. In vain I begged her to remain for a
time with poor Serena and myself and help nurse you.
But she only laughed and said that she could not alter
her plans and postpone her marriage for the sake of a
stranger. I tell you she is gone&mdash;gone forever, Keith;
and she is married to a wealthy man, who is able to
take good care of her. Put her out of your mind at
once; she is not worthy a kindly thought from you."</p>

<p>But he only moaned over and over again, weakly,
brokenly: "I want Beatrix&mdash;Beatrix, my beautiful
Beatrix!" until Mrs. Lynne felt that she should go
mad.</p>

<p>He had relapsed into delirium again, and the worst
was before them.</p>

<p>Days went by; and it was a hand-to-hand fight with
death. And away in that distant Southern city, old
Bernard Dane waited impatiently for his recovery and
return, the only news received by him being the telegrams
which Mrs. Lynne sent him almost daily. Their
import was always the same: "No better." But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
day came at last when, weak and feeble as a newborn
babe, Keith Kenyon struggled back to existence
once more; and the first person upon whom his eyes
rested was Serena Lynne. Constant watching and the
cares of the sick-room had not improved her appearance;
she was more sallow, and gaunt, and unlovely
than ever. His eyes wandered slowly over the grim
figure and smileless face, and he strove to speak.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynne," he said, softly, firmly, believing that
the woman seated at his bedside was the mother instead
of the daughter.</p>

<p>Serena started, and an ugly frown disfigured her
face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynne is not here," she returned, curtly.
"It is I&mdash;Serena. You do not see well, Keith!"</p>

<p>A slow smile stole over his lips; he held out one
feeble hand.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, I am sure," he said, the
smile lighting up his wasted face like a ray of sunlight.
"I am so grateful to you, Serena," he said,
softly. "Under God, I owe my life to you."</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees at the bedside.</p>

<p>"I would not have cared to live if you had died,"
she sobbed, bitterly. "Oh, Keith&mdash;Keith! You are the
very light of my life! Say that you care a little&mdash;even
a little&mdash;for me!"</p>

<p>His face grew pallid, and an awful faintness crept
over him.</p>

<p>"Of course I care, Serena," he faltered, brokenly.
"You are like a&mdash;a sister to me."</p>

<p>"But I do not want to be your sister," she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
boldly. "Let me be something nearer and dearer,
Keith. Let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short with a cry of horror. He had
fainted dead away, and lay back upon the pillow as
white as a corpse. With a wild shriek, and crying out
madly that he was dead, she summoned her mother,
and together they finally resuscitated him. But he
was as weak and feeble as a living man could be.
Should there be a second relapse, no human power
could save him. When at last he had fallen into a
refreshing slumber, Mrs. Lynne beckoned Serena out
into the hall.</p>

<p>"If you have any hope of ever becoming Mrs. Keith
Kenyon," she began in a dry, hard tone, "I advise
you to secure him as soon as possible. Marry
him as he lies upon that sick-bed, or, if that be inexpedient,
make him enter into an engagement to marry
you. I know Keith Kenyon. An engagement would
be as sacred in his eyes as marriage itself. Do your
best, Serena. If you fail to grasp this opportunity,
you are lost. How can you ever content yourself to
drag out your days here in this dead-and-alive place,
with only a pittance to live on, with no pleasures, no
society&mdash;nothing in the whole world but an endless and
wearisome round of distasteful duties, no happiness,
no love. And you <i>do</i> love Keith Kenyon, do you not,
Serena?"</p>

<p>"Love him! Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>She sank into a seat and covered her face with her
trembling hands, while a torrent of sobs shook her
angular frame.</p>

<p>"Love him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Her hands fell helplessly to her side, and the tear-stained
face and eyes swollen and dim with weeping
met her mother's sympathetic gaze.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne had little sympathy with such weakness;
but Serena was her daughter&mdash;her only child&mdash;and the
mother's heart, jealous over her offspring, was sore for
her daughter's sorrow.</p>

<p>"Love him!" repeated Serena, wildly. "I only live
for him! I could not exist without him! Believe me,
mother, this is no exaggeration. If I could not see
Keith Kenyon and be with him sometimes I should
die."</p>

<p>Her mother's thin lip curled contemptuously; but a
glance into the tear-wet eyes and face full of keenest
suffering, and the mother-love and mother-pity&mdash;which
are almost divine&mdash;were in the ascendent once more.</p>

<p>"Bah! Love is only madness. But since you <i>do</i>
love him in this mad way, Serena, <i>you shall marry
him</i>!"</p>

<p>The words were low and fervent. It was as though
that plain-faced, harsh-voiced woman had been suddenly
and mysteriously endowed with the gift of prophecy.
Would the prophecy come to pass? Time alone
would tell.</p>

<p>The days went slowly by, and Keith grew daily
stronger and better. One evening, when Serena was
sitting beside the sofa, to which he had at last been
promoted, he heard the sound of a stifled sob, and turning
his head, found that she was weeping bitterly. He
was still very weak and feeble, and the sight of her
emotion fairly unmanned him.</p>

<p>"Serena! Serena!" he cried, frantically, "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Heaven's sake, tell me what is the matter! Are you
in trouble?"</p>

<p>She lifted her pale face and tear-wet eyes.</p>

<p>"I am in the worst trouble that could happen to a
woman," she faltered. "It sounds shameful and unwomanly
to confess it to you, Keith; but&mdash;but I have
come to dread the time like death when you will go
away from us&mdash;go away from me forever, and leave
me here to a dreadful fate. My heart is breaking
with its sorrow; for I have loved you all my life, and
I love you now so dearly that the thought of not seeing
you gives me the greatest pain that I have ever known.
I did not know that a human heart <i>could</i> suffer so and
yet beat on. Keith, must I give you up? Will you not
try to love me a little, and some time in the future let
me be your wife? I would be such a good wife, Keith&mdash;such
a good, kind, devoted wife! I would be willing
to lay my life down to give you a moment's happiness.
I would live for you, die for you, Keith! Believe me,
I would make you happy, for I would sacrifice my
every hope here and hereafter to that end, and you
would never regret marrying me."</p>

<p>His eyes, dark and dilated, were fixed upon her
eager face with a slow wonder in their dusky depths.
He had never thought of such a thing as Serena
Lynne lavishing such a wealth of affection upon himself.
It did not make his heart thrill with ecstacy to
think of it now.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not understand you," he faltered, brokenly,
manlike, trying to gain time by evasion. "I&mdash;I&mdash;It is
quite impossible, Serena&mdash;quite!"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with an ominous light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are thinking of Beatrix Dane," she cried,
angrily, "you are only wasting your time and committing
a sin. She is another man's wife, Keith Kenyon.
You can never be anything to her."</p>

<p>And Serena never dreamed that the "Uncle Bernard"
with whom Keith Kenyon lived&mdash;his uncle only
by adoption&mdash;was the Bernard Dane who had sent for
Beatrix to come to his home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne and her daughter both had placed no
credence in Keith's assertion that he had been sent
thither to escort the girl to her new home. They
looked upon that as a vagary of delirium.</p>

<p>Serena urged her own cause until the poor young
man's brain, weakened by his long and dangerous illness,
grew too confused to grasp the situation or to
realize what he was doing; and the day came at length
when Keith Kenyon, worn out and weakened in mind
and body until he was as feeble in judgment as a child,
gave an unwilling consent to make Serena Lynne his
wife.</p>

<p>That very day a telegram arrived for him from New
Orleans, short and concise, as telegrams usually are.</p>

<p>It bade him return home at once, if he was able to
travel; for his "uncle" had been stricken down, and
lay at the point of death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A STRANGE COMMAND.</p>


<p>Life had seemed strange to Beatrix in that gloomy
mansion in the Crescent City. From the night of her
arrival she had scarcely seen old Bernard Dane&mdash;a
circumstance which she could not regret; for, try as
she might to shut her eyes to the truth, there was
nothing pleasant or lovable about the old man. He
was, indeed, everything repulsive; and his strange, wild
outbursts of rage and malice against some evil which
he could not prevent or forget&mdash;something hidden
away in his own past&mdash;made Beatrix tremble with terror.
She shrank from the gaze of his shifting dark
eyes, preternaturally bright with some hidden fire
which made them appear like fierce flames ready to
burst forth and devour her. Since the evening of her
arrival she had never again attempted any familiar or
affectionate demonstrations. She had kept at a respectful
distance, and comprehended fully that there
was no possibility of any friendliness between them.</p>

<p>Why had he sent for her to come to his home, only
to treat her with chilling coldness or outbursts of ungovernable
rage? When she thought of the oath that
he had extorted from her&mdash;her solemn promise to wed
the man whom he had selected as her husband&mdash;Beatrix's
heart grew faint and chill with horror. How did
she know but that she had pledged herself to a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
fate&mdash;a dark, an awful future, bound to a man whom
she might hate at first sight? And then she thought
of Keith Kenyon, and her heart grew warm and tender.
Could she ever forget him, even though she
might never see him again? Was it possible for her
to shut her heart against the sweet thoughts which
would intrude&mdash;the few tender words that he had
spoken, and, above all, the light in his beautiful dark
eyes, which had thrilled her to the heart?</p>

<p>"I can not forget him," she would say over and
over, when the unpleasant recollection of the oath that
she had so blindly taken would come back to her memory&mdash;"I
can not forget him, and there will be no use
in trying. Uncle Bernard may force me into a dreadful
marriage if he sees fit&mdash;I suppose I shall have to obey
him, the old tyrant!&mdash;but I shall never forget Keith
Kenyon as long as I live&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>The great, gloomy old mansion was well worth exploring,
for it was like the houses of which one reads
in romances, where some dark mystery seems to be
hidden away secure from the light of day and prying,
curious eyes. There was one room called the tower-room.
Beatrix went there every day, impelled by a
strange and unaccountable fascination, to sit alone and
wonder over and over again for what use the room
had been originally intended. It was reached by a long
spiral staircase, and was built in a circular shape, and
known as the "round room." There was only one
window, and that was merely a small square hole in
the wall, and was covered with a strong iron grating.</p>

<p>For what purpose had this room been intended? In
vain did Beatrix puzzle her brain over the vexed question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Mrs. Graves, the old housekeeper, looked cold
and non-committal when Beatrix at last ventured to
propound the question.</p>

<p>"I really can not tell you, Miss Dane," she said,
shaking her gray head slowly and solemnly. "It has
never been used for anything since I have been in the
Dane family, and that is nearly thirty years now&mdash;just
once!"</p>

<p>The thin lips closed down tightly together, and she
turned resolutely away, as though to give Beatrix to
understand that the tortures of the Inquisition could
draw forth no more information from her.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Beatrix speculated continually upon
the romance which she felt certain must be connected
with the round room in the western wing. She reflected
so much upon the subject, and it grew to be
so all-absorbing a source of wonder to her lonely girlish
heart, that one day she made up her mind quite
bravely to seek for information at headquarters. That
very day, accidentally encountering old Bernard Dane
in the great entrance hall, she ventured to put the
question to him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard," she began in a rather shaky voice&mdash;for,
to tell the truth, she was horribly afraid of the old
man&mdash;"you gave me permission to go all over the
house when I first came here, and I have done so. I
have so little to occupy my time," she added, half
apologetically. "It has interested me very much to
go into all those beautiful rooms. But I would like to
ask you a question. Why was that round room built
in the tower? For what purpose was it intended? I
am greatly interested, and would like to know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped short, awed by the awful look in his
eyes and the strange gray shadow which had settled
down upon his face. Not a word was spoken for
some minutes; he stood as still as a statue, one hand
clutching at the carved back of a Gothic hall chair
with such force that one of the elaborate ornaments
snapped off in his grasp.</p>

<p>"The round room, eh?" he cried in a harsh, croaking
voice&mdash;"the round room in the tower? Ha! ha!
you have been there, then? I ought to have known
that you would have found your way there before you
had been under this roof four-and-twenty hours! So
you wish to know for what purpose the round room
was designed? Ah, Miss Beatrix Dane, you may find
that out sooner than you wish, and the knowledge of
the truth will drive you mad! In the long black nights
and the dreary darksome days, when you will pray for
death and find it not, then you will learn the secret
which is mercifully hidden from you now. Mercifully&mdash;ay,
but why should I show mercy to you or
yours? Mercy! Who has ever been merciful to me?
Do I not owe it to your accursed race that I am what
I am? Ah, Miss Beatrix Dane, ask no idle questions.
You are fated to know for what purpose that room
was built, to know in good time. Don't touch me,
girl!"&mdash;for she had ventured to lay her hand upon
his trembling arm&mdash;"don't dare to touch me, or I will
strike you down at my feet! The very touch of your
hands is pollution!"</p>

<p>She drew back, faint and shivering, as though he
had indeed dealt her a blow; her face was as white as
marble, her dark eyes dilated with unutterable horror&mdash;horror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
too deep for expression. What was this
fearful secret which Bernard Dane held over her head,
continually like a two-edged sword? What effect was
it destined to have upon her future life? She turned
away, faint and trembling. It crept into her mind
then&mdash;dawning upon her with a strange feeling of
uneasiness&mdash;that ever since her arrival at the old mansion
she had been treated in a strangely formal way,
a sort of stand-off-and-don't-touch-me way, which was
remarkable, to say the least.</p>

<p>Her room was in a remote wing of the building.
Everything there was solely for her own use, set apart
for her.</p>

<p>She remembered now, with a faint sickness creeping
over her heart, how strangely Mrs. Graves had
watched her every movement. Did they suspect that
she was going mad? No; it could not be that; for
madness is not contagious, and the precautions with
which she was surrounded looked greatly as though
some contagion was feared and must be guarded
against.</p>

<p>The very dishes upon which she ate were used by no
one else. She had seen Mrs. Graves actually strike
the little maid-servant who one day was about to raise
to her lips the half-empty goblet of milk from which
Beatrix had been drinking.</p>

<p>It was strange and mysterious.</p>

<p>The girl turned away from the sight of the wild,
distorted face of the old man before her with a hopeless
feeling tearing at her heart-strings. She went
slowly back to her own room and sat down at the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"There must be some awful curse hanging over me!"
she murmured, brokenly. "I can not imagine what
this strange mystery means. I wish I could find out.
I wish I might know. Anything is better than suspense!"</p>

<p>Alas! poor Beatrix! ignorance was certainly bliss in
her case, if only she could have known it. The day
would come when she would look back upon this blissful
ignorance and curse the hour when first she had
heard the mystery explained.</p>

<p>That very night old Bernard Dane sent for Beatrix
to come to his room. She obeyed the summons, and
found him crouching over the fire, looking like some
weird priest of old performing an incantation.</p>

<p>"Come here!" he commanded, harshly, lifting his
head and transfixing her with wild eyes as the girl entered
the room&mdash;"come here, Beatrix Dane! Put your
hand into that fire&mdash;right into the flame, I say. Yes;
you must do it. You swore to be obedient to me, and
it is for a good reason that I wish to put you to a
test. I wish to prove the truth. Of course you think
me mad for desiring this, but I am as sane as you
are. This is a test, I tell you. The day may come
when you will see the wisdom of my words. Come;
you must obey me. Don't stand staring at me in that
helpless way. I mean what I say, and I will be obeyed.
Put your hand in the fire, and hold it there quietly for
a moment!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">JUST IN TIME.</p>


<p>Beatrix stood staring blankly into the old man's excited
face, with a strange feeling of sickening terror
creeping over her heart. Was he mad? In Heaven's
name, what did he mean? Was she shut up alone in
this dreary old house with a raving madman? She
stood there, trembling like a leaf, quailing before the
steady stare of his wild, dark eyes burning into hers
with a look of awful meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Bernard!" she faltered at length, striving
hard to steady her tremulous voice, "surely you do
not mean that? You are only jesting, of course. You
surely could not mean for me to do such a thing&mdash;such
an unheard-of thing? Why, think of the suffering I
would endure&mdash;the pain and torture, and don't ask me
to do such a mad thing, Uncle Bernard! And&mdash;for
what purpose?"</p>

<p>His bloodshot eyes gleamed with a curious light.</p>

<p>"For what purpose? That is for me to know, Miss
Beatrix Dane. I have already told you that this is a
test. A test of <i>what</i>, you will ask, with all a woman's
curiosity. But that question I shall not now answer.
Should the test <i>fail</i>, then I shall be at liberty to tell
you all, and you will have cause to be grateful, Beatrix.
But there is no other way to prove the truth
only by this, which seems so absurd to you. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
try and be brave, and obey me, Beatrix. You must
thrust your right hand into the flames; that was the
advice of the physician whom I consulted. 'If you
can induce the young lady to put her hand in the fire,'
so Doctor De Trobriand informed me, 'you will soon
know the worst. If the thing you suspect should prove
to be true, then&mdash;' But there, Beatrix, I must not reveal
to you the rest of the doctor's opinion. That is a
professional secret. Do you still refuse?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>Beatrix's voice was stern, and her eyes full of a
resolute light. Surely the man before her was a lunatic,
and she must not allow him to intimidate her.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> refuse&mdash;absolutely!" she repeated, bravely.
"Your command is not reasonable, and I shall not
obey it. You must be mad, Uncle Bernard, to expect
obedience to such a command!"</p>

<p>"You refuse, eh?"</p>

<p>He started to his feet, white with anger.</p>

<p>"Remember that <i>I</i> know best, and this is best for
you, a necessary test, I say. But since you refuse, I
shall be compelled to use force."</p>

<p>He seized her hands and dragged her forcibly to the
fireside, the poor girl writhing and struggling in his
grasp.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard&mdash;for the love of Heaven, stop!"
she pleaded; "stop and think what you are doing! You
are about to inflict the most terrible torture upon me;
you will doubtless maim me for life. Uncle Bernard&mdash;Uncle
Bernard, for the love of Heaven&mdash;I beg of
you to stop&mdash;to spare me! Please&mdash;please&mdash;<i>please</i>!"</p>

<p>The sweet voice grew weaker and fainter as the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
man forced her nearer the burning coals within the
grate; in his eyes the fire of a fiendish purpose, his
face as white as marble.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to do it, Beatrix," he said in a low,
ominous voice. "If the result proves satisfactory, I
shall be at liberty to explain the mystery to you, and
then you will know the unutterable horror that you
have escaped. If the fire burns you&mdash;<i>pray</i> that the fire
will burn you, Beatrix," he broke off, wildly&mdash;"pray
that your little hand may be scarred for all time, rather
than have that awful curse to fall upon you. Oh, yes,
I know you think me a madman! but listen to me,
child"&mdash;his voice softening a little: "You think me a
madman&mdash;a brute&mdash;a fiend; but when you have heard
the truth you will think differently. I have sought
vengeance all my life, but somehow your piteous eyes
and helpless loneliness have made me feel a little
kinder, and if it were not for Keith Kenyon, and
the debt of vengeance that I owe&mdash;" He stopped short,
checking himself with a strange, half-angry gesture,
as though he regretted having spoken so freely. "This
much I can tell you, Beatrix"&mdash;his voice had fallen
almost to a whisper. There was no sound to break the
awful silence of the room, save old Bernard Dane's
heavy breathing and the dropping of a coal in the
grate. Beatrix stood there, her hands crushed in
his iron grasp&mdash;one would never have dreamed that
the old man was so strong&mdash;and listened eagerly,
breathlessly, to his next words.</p>

<p>"This much I will tell you," he went on, slowly;
"and after you have heard it, I think you will agree
with me. Yours is a fearful heritage, Beatrix&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
heritage of woe. I will not put it into words, for if
you were to know it&mdash;to know the secret of your own
dark inheritance&mdash;it would kill you as you stand there
before me. Beatrix, there is poison in your very
life-blood&mdash;an awful taint suspected, which can only
be proved by this crucial test. Beatrix, obey me; place
your hand in yonder fire, as I bid you. If it comes
forth burned and disfigured&mdash;a mass of horrible burns
and unsightly scars, your body racked with suffering,
then thank your God upon bended knee that you have
escaped the doom of your race. If, on the other hand,
contact with the fire should have no effect upon you, I
advise you, young and fair though you are, <i>to take
your own life</i>! Will you place your hand in the
flame?"</p>

<p>She shrank back, paling and shivering.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;can not!" she faltered. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! <i>You shall&mdash;you must</i>!"</p>

<p>With a swift movement he dragged her close to the
fire, and bending her slight form forward, was about
to lay the little white hand upon the bed of live coals,
when all at once there was a loud peal at the gate-bell.
A moment later, before old Dane could carry out his
horrible intention, the door of the room was thrown
open, and a tall form bounded over the threshold.</p>

<p>One swift glance, and the newcomer sprang to the
fireside, and seizing the old man by the shoulder,
forced him into the nearest seat; then, before Bernard
Dane could recover from the shock of the surprise,
the intruder turned and faced the half-fainting girl.</p>

<p>"Beatrix!"</p>

<p>"Keith!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Keith Kenyon's face was pale and stern, and his
dark eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>"So!" he cried, indignantly. "I come home in answer
to a telegram which declares you to be at the
point of death, Bernard Dane, and I find you in usual
health, and in the very midst of an act of inhuman torture.
Simons told me what was going on as soon as
he opened the door to me. I rushed up here at once&mdash;just
in time, it seems. Bernard Dane, I demand to
know what you mean by such inhuman conduct?
Understand me: if ever I find you attempting a repetition
of this torture, I shall leave you forever, and I
shall take Beatrix with me. She shall not remain here
to be murdered. Keep your money, Bernard Dane;
I do not want it. I will have nothing to do with a
wicked wretch like you!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Keith"&mdash;the old man quavered the name
forth in a broken voice&mdash;"you do not know. It is for
her good&mdash;for your good. If she escapes the awful
doom of her race, she&mdash;No, no, Keith; I must not
tell you."</p>

<p>The old man broke down and buried his face in his
shaking hands&mdash;a pitiable sight.</p>

<p>"Keith!" starting up suddenly and gazing into the
handsome face with horror-dilated eyes, "I had
planned a marriage between you two; but&mdash;but it must
never be. It would be sacrilege&mdash;a crime!"</p>

<p>Keith Kenyon turned, and his dark eyes met the
frightened gaze of Beatrix.</p>

<p>What was that which he read in those timid, trusting
eyes lifted to his face with a shy look? Was it
love?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>With a low cry of rapture, he sprang to her side
and caught the girl's slight form in his arms.</p>

<p>"Beatrix! Beatrix!" he whispered, passionately,
"we have not long known each other, but I love you!
I think I have loved you ever since our first meeting,
when you risked your precious life to save mine&mdash;long
before I suspected the truth&mdash;that you were the young
girl whom I was sent to escort to this place&mdash;this
cursed place where I wish you had never come. I love
you, darling&mdash;love you with all my heart. Be my wife
at once, Beatrix, and we will leave this place. Let
Bernard Dane keep his money; we do not want it.
I am strong, and can work for us both. Say yes, Beatrix,
darling&mdash;say yes! For surely no man ever loved
a woman as I love you."</p>

<p>And then he stopped short, and his heart grew faint
and cold within his breast.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that he was Serena Lynne's
promised husband, that he was bound in honor to make
Serena Lynne his wife.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="center">AN OLD MAN'S SECRET.</p>


<p>Yes, he was Serena Lynne's betrothed husband, and
bound in honor to make her his wife. The sharp
remembrance cut him to the heart like a sword. He
fell back with a cry of anguish, and the love-words
died upon his lips.</p>

<p>"May Heaven have pity!" he groaned. "I had forgotten&mdash;forgotten.
Don't look at me with such piteous
eyes. Beatrix! oh, Beatrix, my love, I have done
wrong! I have made a mistake, and my happiness
is wrecked. All my life is ruined and darkened
forever!"</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane hobbled over to Keith's side and
laid a trembling hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Keith, my boy, I&mdash;I can't explain this to you," he
mumbled, brokenly.</p>

<p>He had not observed the scene which had just taken
place between Keith and the shrinking, trembling girl
who stood there, pale as a lily, before them. He had
not listened to Keith's impassioned avowal; he had
been deaf and unseeing to all that had taken place.
Keith's dark eyes flashed with an angry light.</p>

<p>"I wish no explanation," he returned, harshly;
"there is no excuse, no palliation of your conduct possible.
You have acted the part of an inhuman monster&mdash;a
madman! Yes, let us hope that temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
aberration is responsible for your strange conduct.
Uncle Bernard, I warn you that if your attempt to torture
this poor girl should be repeated, I will appeal to
the authorities. You shall be confined in a retreat
for the insane. You are a dangerous person to go at
large."</p>

<p>The old man seemed strangely weakened and unmanned.
He uttered no word; no sound escaped his
dry, parched lips; but upon his wrinkled face there
was a look of abject terror.</p>

<p>Trembling like a leaf, he turned, and leaning heavily
upon his cane, passed from the room and closed the
door behind him. He went straight to the library&mdash;a
great solemn-looking apartment filled with well-laden
book-shelves, and with a huge escritoire standing beside
a window. The old man hobbled over to the
desk, and taking a bunch of keys from his pocket, he
unlocked the desk and turned to a small drawer at
the right. From this drawer he removed a small package
of old letters tied with a narrow black ribbon.
Removing the ribbon, he began to examine the letters,
reading them over hastily, one by one, the frown
upon his brow growing deeper, his dark, deep-set eyes
flashing with an angry light. When he had read the
last of the letters he replaced the somber ribbon and
returned the package to the drawer. Then bowing his
head upon his hand, Bernard Dane sat buried in profound
thought.</p>

<p>Whatever the subject that engrossed his thoughts,
it was not a pleasant one. That could be easily seen
by the lines of care upon his brow, the furrows of
anxiety&mdash;the evidence of a great trouble&mdash;that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
plainly written upon his face. A look of intense anger
settled down upon it. He clinched his white hands
fiercely, and the deep, dark eyes gleamed like fire.</p>

<p>"To think of it all!" he muttered, harshly&mdash;"all
that I have borne for long years! The horror&mdash;the
agony of it! To think of <i>her</i>&mdash;the woman I loved,
who duped me, deceived me, made a mock of me!
But I canceled the account between us and wiped out
the score!" he went on, with a fiendish chuckle, rubbing
his hands together as he spoke. "I paid her back,
word for word, blow for blow! When I remember
<i>all</i>&mdash;when I think of that death-scene&mdash;I&mdash;I feel amply
satisfied. For all the suffering she caused me, she suffered
fourfold. And was it not almost miraculous that
the man who won her away from me&mdash;the man who
had been my best friend, who had deceived me and
fooled me to the top of my bent&mdash;in short, Guy Kenyon
himself&mdash;should have been placed in my hands&mdash;at
my mercy! He never realized the bliss that would
have been his. His cup of happiness was snatched from
his grasp before he could raise it to his lips, for she&mdash;she
<i>died</i>&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;<i>died</i>! and no one knows&mdash;no one
but old Bernard Dane will ever know&mdash;how and where
she died. Poor child! After all these long years, can
it be that <i>pity</i> has come to life within this hardened
old heart of mine? But I can not help it, when I remember
how they forced her into an unholy marriage
with that old man. But still there were compensations,
for when her babe was six months old he departed this
life, leaving all his worldly possessions to his beautiful
young widow and her infant child. Then Guy Kenyon,
a widower with one son, came to the fore with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
handsome face and winning ways. She had known
him and cared for him previous to her ill-starred marriage
with old Godfrey Dane, and it did not take long
to revive old feeling, to warm over the ashes of the
old love, from which the new arose like a phenix.</p>

<p>"Married or single, bound or free, it was all the
same, she never cared for me. And Guy Kenyon
would have wedded her if fate had not interfered&mdash;fate
in the person of old Bernard Dane. Ha! ha!
Bernard Dane&mdash;but not so old and ugly then as he is
now. <i>He</i> appeared, and in his possession proof positive
of the awful curse which rested upon her&mdash;upon
Mildred Dane. He loved her&mdash;there was no doubt
upon that score&mdash;he loved her, and the knowledge of
this fearful curse which rested upon the woman he
loved <i>killed</i> him. He did not long survive the fearful
knowledge of her secret. Then came the grand <i>finale</i>.
I placed his child Keith, then a boy of ten or eleven,
in the care of respectable people, after which I turned
my attention to <i>her</i>&mdash;to Mildred. I had sworn that
she should be my wife or nobody's. But even I, with
all my great love for her, could not, dared not, make
her my wife with the knowledge of that fearful, that
hideous curse hanging over her like a pall. I do not
like to recall that time," the old man went on, wearily,
pushing back the scanty locks from his wrinkled brow.
"She was like a mad creature when she learned the
truth, when I told her all. Poor, heartbroken Mildred!
She swore that she would take her own life, and&mdash;she
kept her oath. Ah, well!"&mdash;a fearful shudder convulsing
his frame&mdash;"it is an awful thing to reflect
upon. But I could not blame any living creature, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
above all, a young and beautiful woman, for committing
suicide under those circumstances. I risked my
own life in keeping near her as I did; but my heart
was heavy for her sake, and I could not leave her to
meet her awful doom alone. And in return for my
self-sacrifices, she hated me, defied me, died without
one word of kindness to me. <i>His</i> name&mdash;Guy Kenyon's&mdash;was
the last upon her lips. Was it not enough
to harden a man's heart against a woman to whom
he had given all, to whom he had dedicated his whole
life? Her cruelty to me hardened my heart against
her, living and dead. Ay, I even grew to hate her
memory. I fell upon my knees and swore by every
thing holy that I would be avenged.</p>

<p>"After that, as the years rolled by, and I hated
Mildred Dane's very memory&mdash;even as I had long
hated Guy Kenyon; hated him living, hated him dead&mdash;I
finally planned this marriage between the two descendants
of the man and the woman whom I hated.
It is a fiendish plot. I look upon <i>him</i> in his noble,
manly beauty, his true, warm heart and honorable
nature; I look upon <i>her</i> with her beautiful face, so
like that other face once loved, but now in death <i>hated</i>,
and something in the girl's piteous eyes makes my
heart quail. I am not altogether a demon, and I am
sick&mdash;sick of the whole plot. That girl's eyes! They
are Mildred's own&mdash;just as she used to look when she
was a sweet young girl, before they sold her to Godfrey
Dane for money. I can not shut out the look of
appeal in Beatrix's eyes; it makes my heart ache, hard,
and cruel, and bitter though it is. I pity her, I pity
him! I see my own error now, when, oh, God! it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
too late; for they love each other. I would do anything
in my power to prevent the marriage between
them now; but they are young, headstrong, and I
shall fail in my attempt. Then, oh, heavens above!
the very thought of what must come, of what looms
up before them in the dark future, makes me sick and
faint. I have sought the best medical advice in the
country. Doctor De Trobriand, whose specialty is this
particular horror that threatens poor Beatrix's life, has
told me that the fire test is the only possible test of
which he knows. He advised me to attempt it, but
the girl refused. I could not explain to her and tell
her why I made so seemingly absurd and cruel a request
of her. I dared not tell her my suspicions&mdash;my
reasons for making this request; the knowledge would
drive her mad. And I have failed in the attempt, as
I have failed in everything else all my life long.
Curses upon it!"</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet and relocked the escritoire,
and then, with slow, unsteady steps, he returned
to his own room. Beatrix had gone, but Keith was
sitting alone before the fire, his face pale and stern,
his eyes full of sadness. The old man crept to his side
like a penitent.</p>

<p>"Keith, my boy, you will forgive me?" he quavered.
"What I did was for your good&mdash;and hers. Listen
to me, Keith. You will give up this marriage&mdash;this
mad marriage? I&mdash;I had always intended you two to
wed each other. For that purpose I have brought
you together; but since&mdash;since I have lived under the
same roof with that child, my heart is melted somehow,
and I can not consent to the awful sacrifice. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
don't know&mdash;Keith, you don't know&mdash;what a fearful
fate is in store for you if you persist in this mad marriage.
Forget that I had ever planned it&mdash;forget Beatrix
Dane!"</p>

<p>"I can not&mdash;I will not! I love her. Your warning
comes too late, Uncle Bernard."</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head upon his clasped hands,
and a fearful shudder crept over his gaunt frame. It
was all his own fault&mdash;all the result of his own mad
folly. His own hands would now overthrow the fabric
which he had patiently reared; but it was too late, and
only desolation remained. Surely Bernard Dane was
undergoing a strange transformation&mdash;the result of
contact with a pure young being like Beatrix Dane;
the great, sad, dark eyes which gazed so pleadingly
into his face had made the old sinner ashamed of himself.
He saw for the first time in the clear light of
reason his own wickedness, and his soul shrank back
ashamed. How could he ever have formed so vile a
plot&mdash;such a diabolical scheme to entrap two innocent
people&mdash;to wreck and destroy two young lives? Keith
Kenyon felt no pity for him. He never dreamed the
full iniquity of that which Bernard Dane had plotted
to do; but the fact that he had plotted in some way&mdash;that
he had thrown Keith himself and Beatrix together
only to sever the ties between them now, seemingly to
gratify a foolish whim of his own, made the young
man's heart grow hard as steel within his breast, and
a cold chill of horror crept over him. He felt disgusted
with the whole world, and with old Bernard Dane in
particular. Had he known the worst&mdash;the full extent
of Bernard Dane's crime&mdash;he would have fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the house that very night in horror, and would never
willingly have looked upon the old man's face again.
He rose and stood leaning against the carved marble
mantel.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Uncle Bernard," he said in a low,
resolute tone; "but I <i>love</i> Beatrix, and I intend to
make her my wife. I will surmount every obstacle in
the way; but she shall be my wife! Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>He turned swiftly and left the room in haste, as
though determined to prevent any further remonstrance.
Up in his own chamber, he walked straight
over to his writing-desk.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind what to do, and the sooner
the disagreeable task was performed&mdash;was over and
done with&mdash;the better.</p>

<p>"I will do it at once," he muttered, resolutely. "Delays
are dangerous; and, besides, I shall be in a fever
of impatience for the answer. How terrible it will
be to wait for it! Two whole weeks&mdash;fourteen endless
days&mdash;before I can hope to hear from her in reply!
I will write to her at once&mdash;write to Serena Lynne&mdash;and
confess all, and beg her to release me. It was an
absurd engagement at best&mdash;a wrong&mdash;a wicked engagement,
for I do not love her; I have never cared
for her! I shall never care for her, though I live to
be one hundred. <i>Love</i>! Good heavens! the very idea
in connection with <i>her</i> is ridiculous, grotesque! Once
broken off, the engagement will soon fade from her
memory, and she will turn her attention to some more
suitable and worthy object than your humble servant.
She will not&mdash;dare not&mdash;refuse to release me!" he
cried, softly, an awful thought crossing his heart like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
cold, slimy serpent. "She would not be a woman,
with a woman's heart, if she refuses to grant it."</p>

<p>Alas, poor Keith! He did not know&mdash;he did not
realize&mdash;that when a woman like Serena Lynne loves,
her heart hardens against all other women&mdash;the very
love in her heart crystallizes. She will fight for that
love, sin for it, die for it, but she will never give it up&mdash;never&mdash;while
she lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SERENA'S FIRST LOVE LETTER.</p>


<p>For the first time in her life Serena Lynne was
triumphant with the knowledge of a victory won. She
had begun to despair; the prospect of ever winning
Keith Kenyon had been growing "small by degrees and
beautifully less," now flickering up in a wild spasmodic
hope of success, then sinking down below zero
once more.</p>

<p>When she had discovered his evident&mdash;too evident&mdash;interest
in Beatrix, the woman's heart had swelled
with bitter indignation and resentment, and for a time
it had seemed to Serena Lynne that there was no alternative
but to die and escape it all. The anguish was
unendurable; for with all the strength of her selfish
nature she loved Keith Kenyon, and the very thought
of giving up all hope of winning him was more bitter
than death.</p>

<p>But at last she had succeeded&mdash;not in winning his
love&mdash;but himself. There was a vast difference; but
Serena did not pause to reflect upon that point. She
had made up her mind to marry Keith Kenyon; the
sooner the marriage was over with, and he was hers
until death should part them, the better for her. She
sought her mother after the momentous interview with
Keith, a look of excitement and delight upon her face,
her pale eyes flashing with rapture. Mrs. Lynne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
glanced up from the work upon which she was engaged,
and a look of inquiry flashed into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Serena, has anything remarkable occurred?"
she asked tersely.</p>

<p>Serena threw herself down upon the faded sofa and
clasped her thin hands in an affected attitude.</p>

<p>"Mamma"&mdash;in a low, awe-stricken tone, as though
she feared that some one would overhear the wonderful
news which she was just dying to tell&mdash;"Keith
Kenyon has asked me&mdash;has&mdash;has promised to&mdash;marry
me!"</p>

<p>A look of incredulous surprise flashed into Mrs.
Lynne's pale blue eyes; the swift blood dyed her cheek
a sullen crimson for a moment, then faded slowly
away, leaving her as sallow and uninteresting as before.</p>

<p>"Serena!" she exclaimed in a tremulous voice,
"don't be a goose! Don't allow yourself to be misled
by your own wishes, or to overestimate trifles, polite
fibs or foolish nothings, in which some men indulge,
and which mean less than nothing. What foolishness
can Keith have been saying to you that you should
imagine that he wants to marry you, Serena? Why,
it is as plain <i>as anything</i> that he is in love with Beatrix.
He will never propose to you, Serena&mdash;never in
the world&mdash;while Beatrix Dane lives, and if he finds
out that she is still single."</p>

<p>Serena tossed her head.</p>

<p>"All the same, he has done so!" she cried; "at least,
he&mdash;I&mdash;led him on, you know, mamma; it was the only
way. And so he said at last, 'Well, Serena, if you are
willing to accept me without any question of love, I ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
you to be my wife!' And you had better believe that
I did not wait long before I clinched the matter with a
<i>yes</i>," she added, coarsely. "So, mamma, you need not
trouble your head any more in regard to my future;
I shall be all right when I am Mrs. Keith Kenyon and
in my handsome home in New Orleans. I will just
<i>shine</i> in Southern society, and make these New Orleans
women turn green with envy. To think that he
should pass by all the young ladies of the South, to
find a wife in old Massachusetts, will seem a strange
thing to the Southern people. I shall put on a great
deal of style, and just overawe them. I am as good as
the best of them. Am I not Miss Lynne, only daughter
of the late illustrious and eminent physician, Doctor
Frederick Lynne, of Chester, Massachusetts? And as
Mrs. Keith Kenyon, I imagine my position in the fashionable
world will be assured. Oh, mamma, I am perfectly
happy!"</p>

<p>Poor Serena! her happiness was very much like the
house of which the New Testament tells us, which was
founded upon the sand. And when "the rains descended
and the floods came, it fell, and great was the
fall thereof."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynne said very little upon the subject; there
seemed a sort of insecurity in this projected marriage,
which rendered her uncertain in regard to it. She shut
her thin lips tightly together and went on with her
work, and no more was said for the present.</p>

<p>Then came the telegram for Keith which old Bernard
Dane had sent himself. He had come to the
conclusion that Keith was not half as ill as he had
believed himself, and that if something was not done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to rouse him to a sense of his duty he might linger on
in that northern clime indefinitely. But perhaps the
strangest point in this game of cross-purposes was this:
Mrs. Lynne and Serena never once dreamed or suspected
that Beatrix was under the same roof where
Keith was going&mdash;that the same house sheltered her
which was home to him. They had paid no heed to
the address in the letter which had been found in Doctor
Lynne's dead hand; and the remittances for Beatrix
had always been forwarded from New Orleans by
Mr. Dane's lawyer. And, owing to Keith's illness ever
since he had been under the roof of the Lynnes, they
had never known or inquired in regard to the old man
who had adopted him&mdash;not even his name or address.
Even the telegrams which reported Keith's condition
were sent to the housekeeper, Mrs. Graves. It was a
strange complication, and out of this misunderstanding
all the future evil was fated to come.</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane had begun to feel strangely uneasy
in regard to Keith's long absence; so at last the
sham telegram was sent, and brought about the desired
result in Keith's sudden return. But the long journey
following so close upon his severe illness proved almost
too much for his strength, and the selfish old man was
compelled to acknowledge that he had made an imprudent
move. For the day after his arrival home Keith
was unable to leave his bed, and for a week was quite
an invalid. But at the expiration of that time he was
able to come down-stairs, and began at once to look
for an answer to his letter to Serena, which he had
written the night of his arrival home.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in the old brown house in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Massachusetts wilderness, Serena Lynne had been
publishing far and near the news of her engagement&mdash;the
great and glorious news of her engagement to the
rich young Southerner. All the neighbors for miles
around were regaled with accounts of his splendid
home in New Orleans; of his vast wealth, and high
social position; the rich old uncle&mdash;she forgot to explain
that Keith was an adopted heir&mdash;who would bequeath
his immense fortune to Keith when he died;
and, in short, Serena painted her own future prospects
in glowing colors, until the country girls with whom
Serena affiliated were half wild with envious jealousy,
and wondered openly among themselves what any man
in his sober senses could see in that ugly Serena Lynne
to admire, and, more than all, to marry. And the verdict
was rendered unanimously that Keith Kenyon's
lady acquaintances must be few in number.</p>

<p>"I shall have a grand wedding, mamma," Serena announced
confidently at breakfast one morning&mdash;a
breakfast served in slovenly fashion, and partaken
of by the two ladies attired in slatternly morning costumes.</p>

<p>"Of course, so soon after papa's death," went on the
irrepressible Serena, "I can not make a very grand
display; but I mean to be married in April, and I shall
go as far with my wedding festivities as I dare venture
to, under the circumstances. I mean to have a wedding
that will eclipse any other that has ever been
heard of here. All our old acquaintances&mdash;in fact,
everybody in the whole country of any importance&mdash;shall
be invited. We will have the church decorated
with flowers and ferns and spare no expense. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
send to Boston for my wedding-gown. Really, I could
not wear anything from this little place, you know,
mamma; and besides, we owe old Grey such a fearful
bill. I will have white brocade, silk embroidered, with
silver flowers; and I must secure a wreath of real
orange-flowers, out of compliment to Keith. You
know he comes from the land of orange-blossoms. We
will order a wedding-breakfast from Boston&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When do you expect to hear from Keith?" interposed
Mrs. Lynne, dryly. She had had a few hurried
words with the young man before his departure&mdash;just
enough to rivet the chains securely.</p>

<p>Serena's sallow face flushed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know; soon, though, I suppose. And
by the way, mamma, there is Mr. Rogers now&mdash;at the
gate. I believe&mdash;actually believe&mdash;that he has mail
for us. Perhaps it is a letter from Keith!"</p>

<p>She pushed back her chair, and without waiting for
a wrap, rushed eagerly out into the cold, wintry air&mdash;out
to the gate outside of which kindly old Mr.
Rogers had halted.</p>

<p>"Letters, Miss Serena? Yes, to be sure. One for
your ma, and one for you. That's from your sweetheart
down in New Orleans, I see."</p>

<p>Serena tried her very best to call up a blush, but
the sallow skin did not warm, and only the frost-laden
air bit the end of the long, sharp nose until it was
purple.</p>

<p>She seized the letters, and with a shower of voluble
thanks hastened back to the house like a mad creature&mdash;back
to her seat at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"One for you, ma," she announced, tossing a large
yellow envelope into her mother's lap, "and a letter
for me&mdash;from Keith, of course."</p>

<p>Her chilly fingers hurriedly tore open the envelope.
The letter was not very long, but it seemed to Mrs.
Lynne, watching her daughter with ferret-like eyes,
that it took Serena an endless time to decipher its
contents.</p>

<p>All at once, with a low groan, crumpling the letter
fiercely in her hand, Serena slipped from her chair
and lay upon the floor in a dead faint.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.</p>


<p>Keith Kenyon was able to leave his room once more
and rejoin the small household.</p>

<p>During his illness Beatrix had kept to her own room
as much as possible, never voluntarily entering the
presence of the old man, whom she feared as a madman.
His wild dark eyes would follow her with furtive
glances. He seemed secretly watching her, and
more than once she surprised a gleam of wild intensity,
as he seemed to devour her with his eyes.</p>

<p>She grew pale and thin and nervous, and all the
time her heart longed for Keith&mdash;Keith with his tender
dark eyes, and sweet, low voice, and caressing
ways&mdash;Keith who would stand between her and all ill.</p>

<p>She kept herself as much as possible in the vicinity
of the sick-room, and waylaid Mrs. Graves upon any
and every available occasion with eager, anxious inquiries
as to his condition, to all of which Mrs. Graves
made reluctant replies.</p>

<p>It was evident that she did not at all approve of any
ties of interest between her handsome young master
and this girl with the sad, unfortunate history&mdash;her
unguessed secret&mdash;the dark inheritance which hung
over her like a deadly curse.</p>

<p>But the day came at last when Keith was able to
make his way slowly and wearily down-stairs and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the drawing-room, where he sank upon a comfortable
sofa before the fire and uttered a sigh of relief. Then
his eyes wandered swiftly around the room, as though
seeking some one.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Dane?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graves frowned.</p>

<p>"Up in her own room, to be sure!" she made answer;
"and if you please, Mr. Keith, I rather think
that Mr. Dane prefers that she should remain there."</p>

<p>"Remain there, indeed!" indignantly. "And pray
what right has Mr. Dane or anybody else to attempt
to imprison Miss Beatrix Dane, I should like to
know?"</p>

<p>"Imprison? Oh, no, Mr. Keith!" The housekeeper's
voice was full of eager protest. "But then,
you see, there is something unusual about Miss Beatrix;
there is something in her history&mdash;something,
I do not really know what, but I can guess&mdash;and Mr.
Dane thinks that she ought to be kept to herself somewhat,
you see&mdash;not to make too free with the rest of
the family."</p>

<p>"Bah! Nonsense! You are talking like an idiot,
Graves. I&mdash;I beg your pardon, but I can't help it. A
woman of your good, sound common sense ought to
know better than to repeat such rubbish as that. Go
tell Miss Dane that I am here, in the drawing-room,
and ask her to please come to me, since I am not able
to call upon her. I wish to speak with her as soon as
possible. Do, that's a good soul. I know that you will
not find it in your heart to refuse my request, Graves.
You were young yourself once&mdash;not so very long ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Graves turned away, shaking her gray head
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Very well. The consequences be upon your own
head, Mr. Keith," she said, solemnly.</p>

<p>Then she left the room, and he was alone with his
own thoughts&mdash;half angry, half amused.</p>

<p>"The idea!" he exclaimed, his anger getting the
upper hand. "To attempt to keep Beatrix and me
apart! What does old Graves mean, anyway? I shall
ask Uncle Bernard. But then, he, too, certainly appears
to be off his base, as well as the housekeeper.
What a curious old house this is, to be sure! But,
come what may, I mean to know the truth; I mean to
know what Mrs. Lynne and Serena meant when they
said that Beatrix left them to be married. Ah! she's
coming&mdash;my own, my sweet! I hear her light footsteps.
Heaven bless her!"</p>

<p>A pause at the door, then a faint, timid rap upon it.</p>

<p>"Come in!" cried Keith, eagerly.</p>

<p>The door opened slowly, and Beatrix Dane stood
before him. She looked very fair and sweet in her
plain black gown with white crape at throat and wrists,
her golden hair in a loose coil fastened with a jet
arrow.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Mr. Kenyon?" she began slowly,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I did. I wish to speak with you on a matter of
the greatest importance. Come here, Beatrix. You
will pardon me, for I am still something of an invalid."</p>

<p>She came swiftly to his side and extended her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you again and to know that
you are better!" she cried, gladly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beatrix, sit down here by me; I want to ask you a
question. Mrs. Lynne and her daughter both declared
that you had left them to be married."</p>

<p>"Married! I?" Beatrix opened her dark eyes.
"Why, it is simply ridiculous! Mr. Kenyon, you are
the only single gentleman of my acquaintance. The
story is absurd and utterly false."</p>

<p>Keith breathed freely.</p>

<p>"So I thought. Beatrix, listen to me. I want you
for my wife&mdash;my very own&mdash;and"&mdash;he thinks of
Serena Lynne, and a desperate impulse prompts him
to add&mdash;"the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Keith Kenyon is not a dishonorable man; but he
does not love the woman who has forced him into a
distasteful engagement, and he firmly believes that,
when once she learns the truth, she will free him from
the irksome bonds.</p>

<p>Clang! clang! goes the gate-bell. Beatrix starts to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Who in the world can that be?" cried Keith, impatiently.
"Don't go, darling&mdash;do not leave me alone.
It is no one coming in here. Come back, Beatrix, and
tell me when you are going to make me the happiest
of men?"</p>

<p>Tramp! tramp!&mdash;the sound of footsteps coming
down the hall to the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>Beatrix makes a hasty exit from the room by means
of another door just as the voice of Simons, loud and
pompous, announces:</p>

<p>"A lady to see Mr. Keith. She would come in here,
Mr. Keith." The last in a low tone.</p>

<p>And before the astonished Keith can collect his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
scattered senses&mdash;before he has time to recover from
the effects of this crushing blow&mdash;there is the rustle
of a black silk skirt, and a tall, angular, ungraceful
figure bounds over the threshold and flings herself into
his arms. He catches his breath with a cry of astonishment
not unmingled with horror.</p>

<p>It is Serena Lynne!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SERENA'S GAME.</p>


<p>For a moment Keith Kenyon was so astonished, so
utterly overwhelmed with amazement, that he could not
find words to utter. Could it be true? Was it not an
optical delusion? Surely it was a hideous nightmare&mdash;an
ugly dream&mdash;it could not be real. Yet the tall,
angular figure clad in stiff black silk was only too painfully
real to his unwilling eyes; and the voice which
called his name in gushing tones was really and truly
the voice of Serena Lynne, his betrothed wife. A
shiver crept over him; he half rose, then sank back
into the easy-chair, and then at last he found voice.</p>

<p>"Serena! Good heavens! It is really you! What
has happened? Is your mother dead, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead? No, thank Heaven&mdash;we are both living and
well. The fact is, Keith, we&mdash;mamma and I&mdash;closed
up the house the very day after you left us, and decided
upon a little trip. We have been for some two
weeks traveling about now&mdash;and that explains our unexpected
appearance here, our trip being partly on business,
partly for pleasure. Mamma received news from
some of her relatives which made it advisable for us
to come South&mdash;news which may prove of pecuniary
benefit to us. So we placed our house in charge of
Mrs. Rogers and started at once."</p>

<p>She told her falsehood glibly, her sallow cheek flushing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
her pale eyes scintillating. It sounded very reasonable;
and how could Keith Kenyon know that it was
false, or detect the ring of untruth in her story? One
of the most unsuspicious of natures, it was hard to believe
that this woman had deliberately followed him,
ignoring the letter that he had written her&mdash;that letter
in which he had begged her to release him from a galling
bond&mdash;because he loved another woman, and had
never loved Serena Lynne, but had been led into an
engagement while he was too sick and feeble to realize
his own actions.</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke, but Serena Lynne was capable
of this, and much more. At first she had found it
somewhat difficult to induce her mother to co-operate
with her in the scheme which she had concocted; but
one part of her story to Keith was true&mdash;Mrs. Lynne
had received a letter from her sister, the woman who
had once been Keith's nurse when he was a child. She
lived in an obscure town in Louisiana, and had not met
Mrs. Lynne for years. She had to send for her sister,
and Mrs. Lynne could not well refuse to aid her
daughter in her scheme when her own private affairs
called her into the vicinity of Keith Kenyon's home.
And Serena was in dead earnest. She had sworn to
marry this man&mdash;sworn upon bended knee that she
would never give him up&mdash;this man whom she so
madly, insanely loved. She had made this bold move&mdash;risked
her all upon one cast of the die&mdash;and it would
go hard with her before she would willingly resign all
hope and give up the man who was bound to her in
honor, though his chains were of iron, and galled and
clanked so fearfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes sought her face; the sallow, unlovely features
looked more repulsive to him than ever before.</p>

<p>"But, Serena"&mdash;his voice trembling a little with sudden
fear&mdash;"did you not receive my letter?"</p>

<p>"Your letter?" arching her pale brows with assumed
surprise. "Why, how could I, when we left home the
very day after you did? And so you did write to me,
Keith? Thank you. I shall have my mail forwarded
here, and will be pleased to read your first love letter
to me, even though it is a little behind time."</p>

<p>She laughed, but the laugh had a disagreeable tone,
and was a failure.</p>

<p>"'Better late than never,'" she added.</p>

<p>She had seated herself at his side, in the very chair
that Beatrix had vacated. Keith felt a strange feeling
of aversion creep over his heart at sight of her in Beatrix's
place. It was the sort of feeling that one would
experience to see a net closing slowly around one's
head, and know that in a short time one will be securely
imprisoned, with no way of making an escape.</p>

<p>"The servant informed me that you had been ill
ever since your arrival," Serena observed, breaking
the silence between them. "I am so glad to be here.
I shall remain and nurse you."</p>

<p>Keith's face grew paler than before.</p>

<p>"Of course you are only jesting?" he returned. "I
have the best of care, and, in fact, am all right now,
except that I need rest and freedom from excitement.
But first I must ease my mind. Serena, listen to me.
Circumstances have rendered it absolutely imperative
that I&mdash;that you&mdash;My letter contained the information&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped short, frozen into silence by the curious
look in her gleaming eyes. She knew perfectly well
what information that letter contained, but she would
have bitten her tongue off before she would help him
in the matter. And he, poor fellow, was so confused
and embarrassed under the freezing gaze of her pale
blue eyes, that he found himself unable to frame an intelligible
sentence. But as this was just what Serena
wished, she did not offer a helping hand, but allowed
him to flounder among a sea of words only to come to
grief.</p>

<p>He must not make an explanation. He must not
refer to that fatal letter, and acquaint her with its contents.
Her role was ignorance of the contents of the
letter which he had written to her, asking her to release
him from the undesired marriage engagement.
And if he found opportunity to enlighten her in regard
to what that letter contained, Serena knew that her
game would be up.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of anything that may be annoying to
you, Keith," she suggested. "I insist upon your having
perfect rest and quiet. Mamma is at the St. Charles
Hotel," she added, swiftly, as though to change the
subject. "I suppose you will send for her to come
here?"</p>

<p>"Serena, do not think me inhospitable, but you must
remember that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!&mdash;your uncle&mdash;the old gentleman. I will
see him and explain my intrusion. By the way, what
is his name? It is the funniest thing, Keith, but I do
not know the name of your adopted uncle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"His name is Dane&mdash;Bernard Dane," returned
Keith.</p>

<p>The name acted like magic upon Serena. She
started with a suppressed exclamation, and her eyes
dilated with wild surprise which was almost terror.
Why, that was the name&mdash;the very same name&mdash;of the
old man who had sent for Beatrix; and was she not
Beatrix Dane? A slow horror, an unspoken, scarcely
tangible suspicion began to creep through her heart.
Good heavens! was not fate leading her through devious
ways? She shut her thin lips closely together in
a straight, narrow line, and her pale eyes gleamed with
an unpleasant light.</p>

<p>"I fancy that I am just in time," she muttered, fiercely.
"Not a minute too soon, if my suspicions are
correct."</p>

<p>Then turning to Keith, she said, imploringly:</p>

<p>"You will surely allow me to stay here for a time,
Keith? If Mr. Dane will permit me, you will not
object?"</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly. Under the peculiar circumstances
what could he say? He could not turn
her away, and the great old house was amply provided
with accommodations.</p>

<p>"You will be welcome, I am sure," he returned;
"and of course your mother will join you here at
once. I think you need not ask Mr. Dane's permission
to remain, for this is my home, and I am at liberty to
invite my friends here. Only, of course, you will understand,
Serena, that this is a very quiet old house.
No company, no going out to places of amusement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
You will have to be satisfied with an exceedingly quiet
life."</p>

<p>"I shall be with you," she made answer, as though
that argument covered all defects.</p>

<p>Keith sighed.</p>

<p>"I will send the carriage for your mother at once,"
he said.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, something&mdash;a strange foreboding
of some nameless evil&mdash;something which he could
neither define nor understand, crept over his heart and
made it cold and heavy as a stone. Had he dreamed
the truth, and accepted the warning, and shaped his
future conduct accordingly, Keith Kenyon might have
been spared much suffering, and my story would be
minus a plot. But he could not read the future or understand
Serena Lynne's motives, and he was like a
puppet in her hands. And an honorable, upright man,
wholly in the power of an artful, designing woman, has
a very poor chance of escape from her toils.</p>

<p>Keith rang the bell and dispatched Simons for his
master. Old Bernard Dane soon put in an appearance.
As he entered the drawing-room leaning on his cane,
Keith rose.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Uncle Bernard," he began, "for
sending for you; but I knew you would not mind it,
and I wish to present a lady friend&mdash;a lady from
Massachusetts, Miss Serena Lynne&mdash;who with her
mother will be our guest for a few days."</p>

<p>At sound of those last words Serena frowned and
bit her lip. Low under her breath, she muttered
firmly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"A few days, indeed! I have made up my mind to
stay here. I will give up my grand wedding festivities,
and I will be Keith Kenyon's wife before many days."</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane received Serena with old-fashioned
courtesy, politely concealing his surprise at the
unexpected addition to his family. The carriage was
sent at once for Mrs. Lynne, and Serena was conducted
to a room where she could arrange her dress.</p>

<p>"What a grand old house!" she murmured, covetously,
as she followed Mrs. Graves upstairs to a luxurious
sleeping apartment. "How I shall queen it here!
It will not be long now."</p>

<p>As the thought flitted through her brain, there was
the sound of light footsteps coming down the hall.
Serena raised her eyes and paused aghast with wordless
horror.</p>

<p>Coming down the long corridor, straight toward
her, she saw Beatrix Dane!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">COMPLICATIONS.</p>


<p>For a moment Serena Lynne stood glaring down
upon Beatrix with eyes full of blank astonishment,
which Beatrix returned with interest. It was so
strange, so sudden, so unexpected, that for the time
they could only stand and stare into each other's faces.
At last:</p>

<p>"Serena Lynne!"</p>

<p>The name fell from Beatrix's astonished lips like a
groan. Serena's pale eyes flashed with the light of a
wicked triumph.</p>

<p>"You!" she hissed vengefully. "So you are destined
to cross my path wherever I go. How came you
here?"</p>

<p>Beatrix's eyes met her wrathful gaze with a glance
of cool disdain.</p>

<p>"I might ask you the same question!" she retorted.
"I am here, Miss Serena Lynne, because this is my
home now. Old Bernard Dane is my uncle, and I have
a right beneath his roof. May I ask&mdash;what brought
you here?"</p>

<p>Serena's eyes snapped.</p>

<p>"Yes; you may ask, if you like," she said, acidly.
"I came here because my mother and I were taking a
trip through the South, and I had a right to see my
betrothed husband."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your&mdash;betrothed husband?" faltered Beatrix, too
overcome with emotion to realize what she was saying.
"What do you mean, Serena? You must be out of
your senses!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" returned Serena, curtly. "I should
think you would understand the situation by this time,
without any further explanation from me. I am engaged
to be married to Keith Kenyon. Surely I have
a right to come here with my mother when he is ill and
anxious to see me. At all events, we are here, and I
do not intend to leave. This is my room, Miss Beatrix
Dane"&mdash;as Beatrix paused upon the threshold of
the room which Mrs. Graves had assigned to Serena&mdash;"and
I would thank you to leave it!"</p>

<p>Without a word, Beatrix turned and left Miss Lynne
alone.</p>

<p>She flew like a wounded creature back to her own
apartment, and closed and locked its door behind her.</p>

<p>For a time she stood in the center of the room, staring
vacantly before her, not knowing what to think,
her senses were in such a whirl.</p>

<p>What did this mean? Was Serena telling the truth?
If so, then Keith had deceived her&mdash;Beatrix&mdash;in the
most heartless manner; and there was nothing for her
to hope for upon earth. She fell upon her knees beside
the bed and burying her face in the pillows, wept
bitterly. She realized that there was trouble&mdash;more
trouble&mdash;great, black clouds of trouble, growing dark
around her pathway. The very sight of Serena Lynne
was enough to warn Beatrix of fresh cause for grief.</p>

<p>She arose from her knees at last and bathed her face
and arranged her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go to Keith at once," she said, "and ask him
frankly and openly why Serena is here, and what is
she to him?"</p>

<p>But when Beatrix entered the drawing-room a little
later for an interview with Keith, she found Bernard
Dane there, and, of course, private conversation was
impossible. The old man glanced up with a scowl as
Beatrix entered the room.</p>

<p>"Who sent for you?" he demanded, brusquely.</p>

<p>The color arose to the girl's pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"No one, sir," she returned with spirit. "I was
not aware that you intend to cut me off from communication
with the rest of the household."</p>

<p>"That will come soon enough," chuckled the old
man, half audibly; but Beatrix overheard the muttered
words, and her heart sank with a bitter pang. What
did he mean?</p>

<p>"I will ask him when I see him alone," she decided.
"He shall tell me what this strange treatment of me
signifies."</p>

<p>Aloud she said:</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard, may I ask you what brings Serena
Lynne to this house? She is my bitter enemy, my persecutor.
I prefer to go to some other place while that
woman is here!"</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane's sunken eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"You've got the Dane grit and the Dane temper,
my dear," he snarled. "But I advise you to keep it
well in hand when you are with me. The ladies who
are here&mdash;yes"&mdash;as he marked the sudden start with
which Beatrix heard his words&mdash;"Mrs. Lynne is with
her daughter, of course. Eminently proper, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sure; you surely did not think that Miss Serena Lynne
would come clear from the North all alone to visit
Keith?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure. She is capable of a great
deal," intervened Beatrix. Then she added softly:
"Oh, forgive me, Uncle Bernard. I do not mean to be
harsh, and ill-tempered, and spiteful; but the sight of
that woman just stirs up every uncomfortable attribute
of my nature. Uncle Bernard, did you ever know any
one who affected you in that way&mdash;the very sight of
whom would stir up all the worst dregs of your nature
and tempt you to do deeds for which you were afterward
sorry?"</p>

<p>A dull crimson dyed the old man's wrinkled cheeks
for an instant.</p>

<p>"Did I? Humph! Yes; 'in my salad days, when I
was green in judgment'&mdash;when I had good reason to
shrink from the sight of my evil genius, Guy Kenyon."</p>

<p>"Guy Kenyon&mdash;my father!" interrupted Keith, excitedly.
"Now, Uncle Bernard, you must tell me something
about him; for you have never told me anything
and I know so little of him."</p>

<p>"You will never learn any more from me," returned
the old man, harshly, arising to his feet. "And now I
must go and interview Simons. That rascally nigger
is getting unmanageable. One would think that he was
the master here from the way that he conducts himself
lately."</p>

<p>He left the room and closed the door behind him.
Out in the hall he came to a pause, clinching his
shaking hands upon the head of his cane, his face pale
and agitated, a look in the depths of his sunken dark
eyes which was not pleasant to see.</p>

<p>"Guy Kenyon," he muttered, harshly, his bent form
shaking visibly; "I would sooner cut off my right hand
than tell Guy Kenyon's son what he once was to me.
I had never thought of such a thing as learning to care
for Guy Kenyon's boy. But somehow my heart is
melting. I must be in my dotage, for I find my long-cherished
hatred growing less bitter, and revenge does
not seem one half so sweet and desirable as it once
did. The time was when revenge was the only object
for which I existed. Can that time be passing now?
Am I growing weak and foolish as I grow old? There!
Some one is ringing the door-bell. I wonder who
it is?"</p>

<p>Simons made haste to admit the visitor, while Bernard
Dane went slowly into the library. A woman
closely veiled entered, and was shown into the reception-room&mdash;a
woman dressed in black, and who spoke
in a low, hurried tone to the servant. She inquired
for Mrs. Lynne.</p>

<p>"Tell her that her sister, Mrs. Ray, wishes to see
her," she said.</p>

<p>The words reached old Bernard Dane's ears, and a
frown knit his brows.</p>

<p>"It is Celia!" he muttered, his face growing deathly
pale; and he grasped the arm of a chair which stood
near. "Celia Ray! After all those years she ventures
to come here! I wish I could unravel the mystery
which lies hidden in the past, for that there is something
hidden&mdash;something wrong&mdash;I am certain."</p>

<p>He left the library and made his way straight to the
reception-room. The woman was standing at a window,
gazing out upon the green lawn, starred with
gorgeous flower-beds even at this season of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>At sound of the closing of the door, she turned
swiftly, but as her eyes fell upon Bernard Dane's face
she uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"Bernard!" she cried, and her voice trembled perceptibly.
"I did not expect to see you."</p>

<p>He bowed low, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"No? Well, I am here, you see. I have not met
you in a long time, Celia, and I thought possibly you
might be glad to see me once more."</p>

<p>"Glad?"</p>

<p>A swift light flashed into her pale eyes and illumined
her features, and made her almost pretty. A younger
edition of her sister, Mrs. Lynne; but her face was
more refined, and she had a winning way, which contrasted
strongly with Mrs. Lynne's awkward abruptness.</p>

<p>"Glad?" she repeated once more, softly. "You do
not know how glad, Bernard!"</p>

<p>And in those few words one could read a whole volume
of affection&mdash;affection for this cross-grained,
unpleasant old man&mdash;that was truly wonderful. Celia
Ray was the only woman who had ever loved Bernard
Dane. And her love for him had been the bane of
her life, the ruin of her happiness. For his sake she
had lost everything on earth&mdash;all that the human
heart prizes; all ties of home and friends; and all for
naught. For Bernard Dane had not returned her
affection; he had never loved any woman in all his
long, hard life but Mildred Dane, who had not loved
him.</p>

<p>Celia Ray stood gazing into the old man's face with
an eager, rapt expression. To her he was young and
handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not look well," she exclaimed. "I can see
that you have been ill. And you would not let me
know it! Oh, Bernard! why do you treat me with
such hardness? Why have you doomed me to a lonely
life? And yet you, too, are alone."</p>

<p>She sank into a seat and covered her face with her
hands, while under her breath she murmured brokenly:</p>

<p>"Dare I tell him all at this late day? Would he
not kill me if he knew what I have done?"</p>

<p>But at that moment Mrs. Lynne made her appearance,
and then Bernard Dane withdrew. There was
a perplexed expression upon his face, and as he went
slowly back to the library he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"I wonder if she played me false in that affair?
Poor little fool! She did not dream that I could hear
her whispered words just now. What idiots people
are who indulge in soliloquy! I never was guilty of
it in my life"&mdash;forgetting that at that very moment he
was soliloquizing. "Oh, woman, lovely woman," with
a satirical smile, "how exceedingly transparent you are
after all!"</p>

<p>In the meantime, Beatrix was left alone with Keith;
but once alone with him, she found, as is very often
the case, that she could not introduce the subject upon
which she wished to speak.</p>

<p>Keith broke the silence himself.</p>

<p>"Beatrix,"&mdash;in a wistful tone&mdash;"no doubt you are
surprised that Serena has come here. You are no
more surprised and annoyed than I am."</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;her face full of wonder&mdash;"I thought that
you were delighted."</p>

<p>Keith colored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beatrix, darling, I ask you to trust me, and ask
no questions for the present. I will explain all as
soon as possible. Will you try to trust me, darling?"</p>

<p>His eyes were upon her face with a look of entreaty.
What could she say but&mdash;yes?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BETROTHED.</p>


<p>The promise was readily given, for with Keith's
dark eyes gazing into her own with that eager, earnest
gaze, Beatrix could not have refused, even if she had
so desired. And she longed to trust this handsome
young lover, who had won her girlish heart completely.
What one earnestly wishes to do is usually accomplished,
when there is no reason why the obstacles
should not be vanquished; and Beatrix was only too
glad to place confidence in Keith. She sank into the
seat at his side and laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Keith,"&mdash;her voice low and eager&mdash;"you would
not deceive me, would you? Remember, I am at your
mercy, and I am compelled to believe in you. I must
trust you, Keith; I could not live without you now&mdash;I
could not!"</p>

<p>His eyes lighted up with a rapturous light; he
stooped and kissed her white brow.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, darling," he was beginning; but just then
the door opened and Serena sailed into the room.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say, Miss Beatrix Dane," she began,
taking possession of Keith with an air of proprietorship,
"you are a bold creature! I intend to speak to
Mr. Dane in regard to your shameless conduct, here
all alone with Mr. Kenyon. Go up to your own room
and stay there, or I will go to Mr. Dane at once, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
he will see that you keep in future your proper place
in this house."</p>

<p>Beatrix's eyes blazed; her slight form trembled; she
stood trembling, hesitating. But Keith whispered
softly:</p>

<p>"Go, dear; I have something to say to this woman.
I will explain all when I see you again. Beatrix, you
will trust me? You have promised to do so."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>She left the room with hasty steps. As soon as the
drawing-room door had closed behind her, Keith
turned to Serena.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have come back to this room,"
he began, slowly. "I have something to say to you.
Serena, I wrote you a letter which I am very sorry
to find you did not receive. In that letter I told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Keith! Keith! do not break my heart with
unkindness and cruelty now!" she cried, clasping his
hand in both her bony ones. "I suppose in your letter
you scolded me for some deficiency. I ask you to forgive
me for whatever I may have done that has
offended or in any way annoyed you. I beg your
pardon&mdash;I beg your pardon, and I ask you to have
pity and say no more. I acknowledge that I was rude
to that girl Beatrix Dane; but, oh, Keith! remember
that I have had a hard time with her, and much to
bear on her account. She left our humble home after
my mother had cared for her and acted a mother's part
to her for nearly seventeen long years. She left us
with the intention of marrying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! That is false&mdash;false, Serena, and you know
it!" stormed Keith, angrily, losing command of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
temper at last. "This poor girl has been wronged.
I wonder you dare tell me such tales in regard to her,
Serena!"</p>

<p>Serena shook her head slowly, mournfully.</p>

<p>"Truly, you are 'in the snare of the fowler'," she
quoted, sagely. "That wicked girl has woven her net
about you, and 'you are forever lost'."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he cried, angrily. "Serena, I thought
you possessed more common sense. Forgive me&mdash;I
am very rude; but you are driving me wild with your
insinuations in regard to Beatrix. However, I wish
to speak of something else; I wish to say, Serena, that
I have written you in regard to our engagement&mdash;the
foolish, ill-advised engagement existing between you
and me. It has been a mistake from the start, Serena,
a great and unwise mistake; we must rectify it now."</p>

<p>"How? Oh, Keith! Keith! don't you care for me
at all?"</p>

<p>"I told you, when I asked you to be my wife, that I
had no love for you, and yet you were willing to accept
me without love. Pardon me, Serena, but when a
woman accepts an offer of marriage from a man
who openly acknowledges that he does not love her,
she must be prepared to accept all the consequences
of her own rash and ill-advised act&mdash;all the shame, the
grief, and humiliation. Serena, I have never loved you&mdash;I
never shall; and I love another woman with all my
heart, and soul, and strength! It is my desire that this
foolish engagement be broken off at once&mdash;at once.
You will thank me some day that I had the courage to
put an end to it before it was too late."</p>

<p>Silence, awful silence, settled down upon the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
You could hear distinctly the beating of Serena
Lynne's heart, as she sat staring straight before her
into space with a numbed, awful look upon her face
which might have touched a heart of stone. Keith felt
his own heart grow sore with sorrow for her suffering,
but he felt that he was doing right, like the surgeon
who pities and sympathizes inwardly with the
sufferer before him, yet must not hesitate to plunge
the sharp, keen knife into the wound, or the sufferer
will die. He felt that he must end all this unpleasant
complication with Serena before another day had
passed, or he could not tell into what trouble his own
mad act might lead him.</p>

<p>"I have done wrong," he muttered to himself, "in
asking her to marry me. I must have been mad&mdash;mad!
But it is not too late to rectify the mistake, and I must
end this affair at once and forever."</p>

<p>But still Serena sat like a statue and did not speak
or move. Keith began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>"Serena," he said, gently, "I do not wish to wound
you, but there must be a final understanding between
us now."</p>

<p>"There shall be," she cried, angrily, starting up.
"I consider the engagement at an end. I release you!
Now, go and marry Beatrix Dane; but my opinion is,
that you will rue the day that you were guilty of such
mad folly! Good-bye, Keith Kenyon, may you be as
happy as you deserve!"</p>

<p>But as she left the room, her face working convulsively,
her breath coming in broken gasps, she was
whispering softly to herself:</p>

<p>"He shall never marry her&mdash;never! I swear that,
come what may, Keith Kenyon shall be mine! It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the one object of my life. I shall not give it up without
a struggle!"</p>

<p>But slowly and surely the hour was coming when
Serena Lynne would be forced to say that all hope was
vain.</p>

<p>That very day Keith made up his mind to take a decisive
step. He would make Beatrix his wife at once&mdash;privately&mdash;and
then no matter what might happen, she
would have him to defend and protect her. And nothing
should ever part them, nothing could ever come
between them save death. The more he thought of it
the more determined did he grow. At last he rose and
made his way slowly out into the grounds, lying fair
and green in the wintry sunshine as though it were
spring. Still weak, Keith felt the balmy air revive
him and strengthen him, and found that after a little
he was able to walk quite well.</p>

<p>Down in a pretty honeysuckle bower he found Beatrix
sitting on a rustic seat, pale and silent. She
looked as if she had been crying.</p>

<p>"Beatrix!"</p>

<p>The sound of his voice made an electric thrill run
over her. She started to her feet.</p>

<p>"Is it really you&mdash;out at last?" she cried. "Oh,
Keith! I am so glad!"</p>

<p>He took her hands in his and drew her head down
so that he could look into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he whispered, tenderly, "I want you
to be my wife at once&mdash;without any delay. Listen.
There is nothing between Serena Lynne and me&mdash;absolutely
nothing&mdash;believe me, darling. Now this is my
plan: I will send today and procure the license; tomorrow
we will drive in the carriage to a clergyman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
house&mdash;the drive will do me good&mdash;and you shall come
back my little wife. Then no one can part us&mdash;never,
while we live. Will you consent, Beatrix?"</p>

<p>The beautiful dark eyes wavered from before his
eager, passionate gaze; she trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Say yes, Beatrix. There is no one to object. We
have no one to consult. Remember, Uncle Bernard
wished us to marry. Say yes, dear, and make me perfectly
happy. No one ever loved a woman as I love
you, my beautiful brown-eyed darling!"</p>

<p>And so the answer was given&mdash;that one little word
of three letters which was large enough to cover a
whole life-time of future woe. The secret marriage
was arranged to take place on the following day.
Keith felt a strange dislike to revealing the truth to
old Bernard Dane, after what the old man had said
concerning a marriage with Beatrix&mdash;the very marriage
which he had himself first planned. Keith felt
certain that Bernard Dane would now bitterly oppose
the marriage, and Keith determined that he would not
give the old man a chance to do so. So the fatal plot
was formed, the secret marriage arranged, and they
parted that night with the understanding that on the
morrow Beatrix would become Keith Kenyon's wife.</p>

<p>At that very moment, up in her own room, Serena
Lynne was hurriedly turning over the contents of her
trunk, her face pale as death, her eyes full of hatred.
All at once she snatched up from the depths of the
trunk a small tin box.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Beatrix Dane!" she hissed, revengefully,
"if I am not mistaken, I have you in my power at
last!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW.</p>


<p>Alone in her room that night, Beatrix sat down at
the open window to think over the new life so soon
to be unfolded to her. Keith Kenyon's wife! No
position in the world could be so desirable; no girl was
ever so happy as she.</p>

<p>"He is so noble, so good, so grand!" she thought to
herself, her fair cheek flushing with rapture at thought
of her lover's perfections. How noble he appeared in
her eyes! How handsome, how manly! To her there
was but one man worth looking at in the world&mdash;handsome
Keith Kenyon.</p>

<p>The moments glided by, still the girl sat there
wrapped up in her own thoughts. Only think, tomorrow
at this time she would be his wife&mdash;his wife!
Surely there could be nothing more to be desired on
earth.</p>

<p>"How hard I will try to please him and to make him
happy!" she whispered softly to herself, her eyes fixed
upon the calm, starlit sky above her head, her heart
beating fast with rapture. "Oh, Keith!" she murmured
half aloud, "I pray the good God to make me
worthy of your great love. I will be a true and faithful
wife, and all the rest of my life shall be dedicated
to making you happy&mdash;my Keith! my king!"</p>

<p>As the words passed her lips some subtle instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
warned her that she was no longer alone. She turned
her head, and her face grew pale as death as her eyes
fell upon the form of Serena&mdash;Serena Lynne watching
her with intense hatred in the depths of her evil eyes.
With a stifled cry Beatrix started to her feet. Serena
glided swiftly, softly to her side.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in my room at this hour?"
demanded Beatrix, sternly. "How dare you intrude
upon my privacy without an invitation? What evil
errand brings you here?"</p>

<p>Serena's eyes snapped; she set her teeth down hard
upon her thin under lip, and clenched her hands as
though she would like to clasp them around the girl's
white throat.</p>

<p>"Upon what errand do I intrude here at this late
hour?" she repeated, hissing the words sibilantly forth
from between her clenched teeth. "I will very soon
enlighten you, Miss Beatrix Dane. I have come here
to ask you a question. Is it your intention to marry
Keith Kenyon? Ah, yes! I know&mdash;I suspect&mdash;a great
deal. I have released him from the engagement between
us; but I have only done so for a purpose. I
wished to bring him to his senses in regard to you, and
I think that I shall be able to do so. I have laid a
plan, and the first step was to sever all ties between
Keith Kenyon and myself, and then&mdash;then I come to
you as an auxiliary in the next move in the game&mdash;a
game played for the welfare of Keith Kenyon&mdash;his
future happiness! Beatrix Dane, I demand of you, is
it your intention to marry this man&mdash;this man who belongs
to me in the sight of God? Answer me! I demand
it! I will have the truth!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>But Beatrix did not reply. She sat gazing out into
the misty night, her eyes full of bitter sorrow.</p>

<p>She was conscious of nothing&mdash;she heard nothing,
saw nothing&mdash;only over and over in her ears those
words hard and cruel repeated themselves: "This
man who belongs to me in the sight of God!"</p>

<p>"Will you answer me?"</p>

<p>Serena's voice cut across the silence like a knife.</p>

<p>Beatrix started, and a shudder ran over her slender
frame.</p>

<p>"Yes; I will answer you," she returned, bravely.
"I am going to do as I think best in this matter, Serena;
and I certainly shall not consult your wishes.
Keith Kenyon is nothing to you&mdash;nothing&mdash;less than
nothing!"</p>

<p>Serena's face was pale to ghastliness; her form
shook perceptibly, her eyes scintillated. She was a
very unlovely picture of anger&mdash;impotent, restrained
rage&mdash;as she stood there.</p>

<p>"Be careful!" she hissed; "be careful, Beatrix
Dane! I give you fair warning; you are treading upon
dangerous ground; you are making a grave mistake.
It would be better for you if you had died when you
were born rather than to cross my wishes. Now, answer
me one question. You think that you love Keith
Kenyon&mdash;would your love change or alter if you were
to learn that he is no longer wealthy; that old Bernard
Dane has altered his will, and intends leaving his fortune
elsewhere? How would you like to be Mrs. Keith
Kenyon and live in a cot, and do your own housework,
and be compelled to see him toil like a slave
from day to day, because he had taken upon him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
burden of a wife? Answer me that, Beatrix Dane!
Is your love unselfish enough to give him up rather
than see him reduced to that?"</p>

<p>"My love is great enough and unselfish enough to
make any sacrifice for his welfare," returned Beatrix,
her sweet voice trembling audibly; "but it would not
make him happy to give me up. I am willing to share
poverty with him. Does not the marriage service bind
us 'for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer'? Oh,
Serena! you must have a strange opinion of my love if
you think that I would turn away from him because he
had lost his inheritance."</p>

<p>"His inheritance!" cried Serena, scornfully; "and,
pray, what is yours? Do you suspect? Ah! my
young friend, if you knew, if you held in your possession
the fatal truth which I have good reason to believe
is connected with your life, you would commit suicide
rather than marry Keith Kenyon."</p>

<p>"Serena, I have heard enough of this," retorted Beatrix,
her temper getting beyond her control. "Be
good enough to retire; for it is very late, and I am
tired and sleepy."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, to be sure!" sneered Serena. "You long
to be asleep that you may dream of your handsome,
dark-eyed lover! But wait a moment, Beatrix Dane.
This is the last time that I shall trouble you. Will you
heed me when I say that I have reason to believe that
you are destined to wreck and ruin Keith Kenyon's
life? There is something that you have yet to learn
concerning yourself; and when you do learn it, you will
curse the hour that you promised to become his wife&mdash;something
which will ruin and curse his whole existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
as well as your own, and make life a scene of
horror to you both! Will you believe me when I
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Beatrix could bear no more. She moved swiftly
to Serena's side, and laying her hand upon her arm, led
her to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Now, go!" she commanded.</p>

<p>And Serena was so overwhelmed with astonishment
that she silently obeyed.</p>

<p>Beatrix closed the door sharply and turned the key
in the lock, and, left alone at last, she prepared to
retire.</p>

<p>She was soon asleep, and her last thoughts were of
Keith Kenyon and how dear he was to her. She
thought, too, of Serena's strange words and hidden
threats; but she could see too plainly that Serena was
half insane with jealous hatred, and Beatrix shut her
heart upon her vile insinuations. And so at length she
sank away in peaceful slumber, unconscious of the
dark clouds slowly but surely gathering about her, and
soon to break in awful ruin upon her defenseless head.</p>

<p>A strange future&mdash;a strange fate&mdash;lay spread out
before her&mdash;a thorny path for her little feet to tread.</p>

<p>Had she known the bitter truth, Beatrix would not
have wished to awaken again in this world. But she
did not know, and it was well that she did not; for the
knowledge of her awful fate&mdash;her dark inheritance&mdash;would
have driven her mad. And yet, some day she
must know&mdash;she must know! Poor child! let her
dream on now in innocent unconsciousness of what the
future has in store for her. Soon enough the day will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
come when Beatrix Dane will pray for the boon of
death, the peace and quiet of the grave!</p>

<p>In the meantime, alone in her own room, Serena sat
before a table upon which she had placed the tin box.
She looked like a fiend gloating over the possession of
another human soul as her long fingers touched carefully
the scorched and blackened fragments of that
fatal letter which Doctor Lynne's last act on earth was
to destroy, hoping to hide forever the secret which it
contained.</p>

<p>"I will do it!" muttered Serena, hoarsely, her eyes
sparkling with hatred and malice. "I will take these
papers tomorrow to an expert&mdash;I know just where to
find one&mdash;and I think they can be deciphered. And&mdash;then"&mdash;arising
to her feet and clinching her cold
hands fiercely together&mdash;"Miss Beatrix Dane, I shall
hold you in the hollow of my hand!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SERENA SUCCEEDS.</p>


<p>That night Beatrix dreamed a strange dream. She
thought that she was alone in the mysterious round
room in the western tower, gazing upon a portrait
which hung upon the wall&mdash;the portrait of a woman&mdash;a
beautiful, dark-eyed, sad-faced woman, the sweet lips
parted with a smile&mdash;surely the saddest smile that ever
touched human lips. And as Beatrix gazed, spell-bound,
upon the portrait, the painted lips seemed to
open and breathe softly the one word:</p>

<p>"Beware!"</p>

<p>Under the spell of a weird fascination, Beatrix stood
before the portrait in her dream, her heart beating fast
with a strange terror, her limbs trembling, a cold chill
creeping slowly over her. She seemed on the verge
of suffocation; her breath came in fitful gasps.</p>

<p>She awoke. Good heavens! where was she? She
found herself alone in the round room in the western
tower, in her long white night-robe, with a lighted
lamp in one hand, gazing about her with wild, dilated
eyes. How had she reached that room, traversed the
long corridors, ascended the spiral staircase in her
sleep?</p>

<p>With a shivering terror creeping slowly over her, the
girl was about to turn away and retrace her steps to
her own room; but at that moment her eyes fell upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
small knob, like an electric button, in one of the panels
of the wall. She had never seen it before, notwithstanding
her frequent visits to the room. It was at the
very spot where in her dream she had seen the portrait.
Impelled by a strange impulse, Beatrix pressed her finger
lightly upon the knob. It moved, and the wooden
panel slowly revolved, turned outward, and revealed
the portrait of a woman's face&mdash;the very face of her
dream. She stood before it pale and trembling, full of
a strange terror for which she could not find a name.
Would the painted lips open and speak even as in her
dream?</p>

<p>Who was the woman before her? She drew nearer
and peered curiously into the painted face. There was
a look of piteous sadness in the large, dark eyes, as
though an awful doom was resting upon her. As she
gazed spell-bound, her sharp eyes caught a glimpse
of a name affixed to the portrait. She bent her head
to read it, and her heart gave a great bound and then
stood still, for the name was Mildred Dane. So this
was her mother, her own dear mother, whom she had
never seen, whom she could not remember. Why was
the picture hidden away in this room&mdash;this mysterious
room&mdash;in the deserted and unfrequented tower? What
strange mystery enshrouded the fate of Mildred Dane?
How had she suffered? For that some tragedy was
connected with her life Beatrix had long been convinced,
and it needed only a look into that beautiful,
heart-broken, hopeless face to confirm her suspicions.
Why was the portrait hidden here, and what was the
secret of Mildred Dane's life? In vain did Mildred
Dane's daughter turn the question over in her mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
there was no answer. But as she stood staring blankly
into the pictured face before her she caught a glimpse
of a folded paper lying in the embrasure where the
picture stood. When it swung around and disclosed
itself there was a narrow space left behind, and there
the paper lay. Beatrix snatched it up.</p>

<p>"I will see what it is!" she exclaimed. "This is my
mother's portrait, and I have a right. Tomorrow I
will demand of Bernard Dane why her portrait is hidden
here, its face to the wall, alone in this dreary room
which was used in times past for God only knows
what dreadful purposes. I must know the meaning of
this mystery!"</p>

<p>Grasping the folded paper in one cold hand, Beatrix
made her way back to her own chamber, locked herself
in, and sat down to examine the paper so strangely
come into her possession.</p>

<p>It was a letter addressed to Bernard Dane in a delicate
hand, the ink faded, but still legible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have loved me, Bernard Dane"&mdash;so ran the
written lines&mdash;"and I am grateful for your love,
though I can not return it. But since you have told
me all&mdash;all the bad, black secret of my doomed life,
which has been concealed from me until now&mdash;I feel
that with love or ties of friendship I have nothing to
do. For me there can be no earthly affection, no love-lit
future, no tender care. The ties of home, the love
of little, innocent children are not for me. Oh, Bernard,
surely, in this bitter knowledge that has come
upon me at last, you are amply avenged! for I am
accursed&mdash;accursed! The heritage into which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
come&mdash;descended to me straight from my South American
ancestors&mdash;has wrought the ruin of my whole life.
Yet I never knew it, never suspected it, until it was
too late, and they had forced me to marry old Godfrey
Dane. Upon my little child&mdash;my little, innocent
Beatrix&mdash;the curse will descend&mdash;the awful curse
which has desolated my life. Her dark inheritance
will come upon her, and she will long for death, and
curse the mother who gave her birth. Oh, Bernard,
Bernard! pity me and help me to escape. Kill me,
Bernard, will you not? It will be such a grand relief
to be free from this horrible burden&mdash;to be done with
this curse, and get out of the world&mdash;anywhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the writing ceased abruptly, and the letter
ended with its grewsome secret still untold. Beatrix
crumpled the letter in her shaking hand, and rising to
her feet, began to pace to and fro, her face as white
as the face of the dead, her eyes wild with horror&mdash;the
madness of despair.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," she groaned, desperately,
"what is this secret&mdash;this maddening, tantalizing secret&mdash;the
curse which has ruined my mother's life, and
which I firmly believe brought her to her death? Oh,
God, have pity, and deliver me from this awful curse!
But if I must suffer&mdash;if I can not get free&mdash;let me
know&mdash;in pity and mercy let me know the nature of
the awful blight which hangs over my life like a
curse!"</p>

<p>Alas! poor Beatrix&mdash;poor, unhappy child&mdash;she is
destined to learn soon enough; and when that hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
darkness comes, prone upon her face in the dust, she
will cry aloud in bitter anguish, "Oh, God!&mdash;my God!&mdash;why
hast Thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>But at last, worn out with her bitter thoughts, and
faint and exhausted, the girl crept into bed once more;
and her last thoughts, as her head rested upon the pillow,
were of Keith Kenyon, and the morrow, which
was to be her wedding-day, and, although she dreamed
it not, a day of doom.</p>

<p>Morning dawned fair and clear, with the sunshine
glinting over the smooth lawn, where even in this wintry
season the grass was green, and with birds chirping
in the branches of the trees&mdash;quite a holiday time.
Beatrix arose early, and the first object upon which her
eyes fell was the letter which she had so strangely discovered
the night before.</p>

<p>At least that was no dream.</p>

<p>She dressed herself and made her way at once to
the round room in the western tower; she wished to
restore the portrait to its former position. But when
she entered the round room there was no trace of a
portrait to be seen; even the brass knob had disappeared.
Dazed and bewildered, the girl left the room
and went down-stairs and out into the grounds. She
felt restless and uneasy; her heart was weighed down
with a strange foreboding. Yet today was to be her
wedding-day.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast Serena announced her intention
of going out. She and Mrs. Lynne were to take
their departure in a day or two, and Serena declared
that she had important business to attend to which
might occupy her all day. There was an unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
glitter in her pale eyes as they rested upon Beatrix's
face; and Beatrix fancied that there was something
like concealed triumph in the tones of her shrill voice.
The girl's heart sank like lead in spite of her efforts to
be brave, for well she knew that that look upon Serena
Lynne's face boded evil to somebody.</p>

<p>"No matter," she whispered softly under her breath;
"after today they can not harm me. I shall be Keith's
wife&mdash;Keith's own beloved wife. He will protect me
from all ill."</p>

<p>Serena donned a street dress and set forth, her veil
drawn closely over her face, as though to conceal her
features, one gloved hand holding tightly, as though it
was precious, a small tin box. Her pale eyes glittered
with exultation behind the folds of her tissue veil;
she seemed eager and anxious.</p>

<p>So she was. Just as eager and impatient to begin
her dreadful work as the vulture which waits greedily
for the corpse to putrefy upon which it expects to
make its horrid feast.</p>

<p>She made her way down-town to the very outskirts
of the business quarter of the city.</p>

<p>Pausing before a long row of offices in a dingy-looking
building, she drew a card from her pocket and
glanced at an address upon it. Her face lighted up
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I believe I am right," she said, half aloud. "This
is the place."</p>

<p>She entered a doorway and ascended a flight of
bare stairs.</p>

<p>A little later she was standing in an office, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
presence of a pale, grave-looking, elderly man who
was seated at a long table covered with papers.</p>

<p>Serena advanced and laid the box upon the table.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Demorest, are you not?" she began,
abruptly.</p>

<p>The man bowed and rose to offer her a seat. She
checked him with a slight gesture.</p>

<p>"No thanks; I will not detain you. I have here the
fragments of a letter supposed to be important, and
which has been exposed to fire. I ask if you can decipher
its contents. Please examine and let me know."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he lifted his head from the small
heap of smoke-scorched paper before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," he returned, gravely; "I have reason
to believe that it can be deciphered. I promise you
in a few hours' time to restore to you the contents of
the letter."</p>

<p>"Very well." Her eyes were blazing. "I will leave
them now and call later in the day. Restore the contents
of that letter so that it can be easily read, and
I will pay you handsomely."</p>

<p>And drawing her veil closely over her face, she left
the office, her evil work well done.</p>

<p class="center">HOW THE SECRET IS TOLD.</p>


<p>When Serena had left the house, Beatrix went
straight to old Bernard Dane's room and rapped at the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" cried a harsh voice; and Beatrix pushed
the door open and entered the room. Bernard Dane
was standing before a window, gazing out into the
grounds, his wrinkled face looking grave and thoughtful.
At sound of the girl's footsteps he turned slowly,
and as his eyes fell upon her pale, troubled face, something
like pity flashed into his own&mdash;but only for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded, sharply, as she paused before
him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard!"&mdash;Beatrix's voice was low and
hurried. She shrank from the interview, yet she felt
that she must go through with it&mdash;"I have intruded
upon you to ask you a question. I am here to demand
of you the secret of my mother's life and death. Why
is her portrait hidden away in the round room, with
its face turned to the wall? What is this secret which
<i>killed</i> her, and which her own handwriting declares
is destined to descend, like a curse, upon the head of
her child? Uncle Bernard, I must have an answer!
This silence is unjust; it is cruel; it is maddening!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Tell me, what is this secret connected with my mother?
I <i>will</i> know!"</p>

<p>The old man's face was a study as he stood listening
to her eager outburst, his keen, dark eyes fixed
upon her face with a penetrating look in their depths.
He shook his gray head.</p>

<p>"My dear, I will not. Now, that is all, and it is
quite useless to ask me any more questions. And
there is no one else in the world who can enlighten
you; so it will be useless to seek information elsewhere.
Beatrix, my child, why torture yourself in this way?
Be content as you are, and do not seek to look back
upon the past, or trouble yourself in regard to the future.
See here, child!"&mdash;the old man's voice softened
insensibly&mdash;"you must believe that I am acting for
your good. When you first came here I resolved upon
a step, the very thought of which now fills my heart
with horror. I had wished to see you and Keith married,
but now&mdash;Oh, my God! I would sooner see you
both in your graves."</p>

<p>"<i>Uncle</i>!"</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;too true, Beatrix. I am going to send
you away from this place. If you remain here, you
and Keith will marry, even against my wishes&mdash;I feel
it. And it would be better&mdash;much better for you to
be dead and buried than to take such a step. Do you
hear me, Beatrix?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the sweet voice trembling, but in the
great dark eyes a look of determination. Ah, Bernard
Dane, your warning comes too late! You have sowed
and you must reap. If a man sows tares he can not
harvest wheat. She turned and left him alone without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
another word. Give up Keith Kenyon? Not if she
knew it; on the contrary, the girl felt more determined
than ever to become Keith's wife.</p>

<p>"He is the only creature in the wide world who loves
me, and I love him with all my heart. My darling! I
<i>will</i> be his wife, and we can not help being happy, even
though Uncle Bernard should disinherit him."</p>

<p>She went to her own room and sat down to think
over the situation. She did not wish to disobey her
uncle; but Bernard Dane had no right to dispose of her
as though she were a toy, a puppet in his hands. She
would not endure it.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! how unjust!" she exclaimed, indignantly.
"He did all in his power to make us care for
each other, and now, when it is too late, he wants to
separate us. He must be mad!"</p>

<p>As she sat there absorbed in reverie, a message came
from Keith asking her to come out into the grounds.
She made haste to obey the summons, and once out in
the grounds together, they discussed the coming event.</p>

<p>"It is all arranged, my darling," he said, as he kissed
the sweet red lips, "and in a few short hours you will
belong to me, never to part on earth&mdash;never any more."</p>

<p>She had meant to tell him of her interview with
Bernard Dane, and the old man's stern command that
they should forget each other; but it seemed a pity to
trouble him or cast a cloud upon his happiness. And,
after all, Keith was his own master. So she held her
peace and said nothing of her interview with her
uncle; and thus she made a fatal mistake. Had she
confided all to her lover, he would have demanded an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
explanation from Bernard Dane, and much unhappiness
and suffering might have been prevented.</p>

<p>But what lover ever listened to reason? A vague
uneasiness had stolen into Keith's heart; but he accounted
for it by the peculiar circumstances in which
they were placed, and resolved to say nothing that
would trouble her.</p>

<p>He was happy&mdash;very happy&mdash;in the prospect of
making Beatrix his wife so soon.</p>

<p>"Darling," he said softly, pressing the light form to
his heart, "everything is arranged. We will drive out
at three in the pony-carriage. We will go direct to
Mr. Darrell's house&mdash;the clergyman who is a friend of
mine&mdash;the license is already procured; nothing to wait
for&mdash;not even the ring."</p>

<p>Drawing a tiny velvet case from his pocket he displayed
a heavy gold band, and with it a glittering diamond.</p>

<p>"Here, sweetheart, let me put on the badge of your
slavery," holding up the diamond as he spoke. Then
with a swift glance into the lovely, downcast face he
slipped the ring upon the third finger of her left hand.
But Beatrix did not need a ring to remind her of her
love for Keith.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We broke no gold&mdash;or sign<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of stronger faith to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wear his last look in my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which said, 'I love but thee!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Three o'clock found the two lovers seated in the
carriage on their way to the clergyman's house. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
little later Beatrix Dane came forth, Beatrix Dane no
longer, but Mrs. Kenyon. How different everything
seemed! the whole world was metamorphosed to her
eyes. She glanced into Keith's face with a look of
wordless love.</p>

<p>"Oh, Keith," she whispered, softly, "I am so
happy!"</p>

<p>It was the last time that such words were destined
to pass her lips for many a dark and dreadful day.
They reached home, and Beatrix went straight to her
room. She wanted to be alone and think over her new-found
happiness. She gazed upon the wedding-ring
on her finger as she hid the marriage-certificate away
safely in her desk.</p>

<p>"My husband!" she whispered, softly. "Nothing can
part us now&mdash;nothing but death! No one can come between
us now&mdash;never while we live!"</p>

<p>Hark! what is that? The sound of voices&mdash;women's
voices&mdash;fell upon her ears.</p>

<p>It was Serena and her mother in an empty room adjoining
Beatrix's chamber. They had gone there for a
private conference, and did not dream that she would
overhear.</p>

<p>"Mamma,"&mdash;Beatrix heard Serena's sibilant voice,
and a shudder passed over her&mdash;"I know all the whole
fearful secret at last, and Beatrix Dane will never
marry Keith Kenyon now. I know the nature of the
awful curse which descends from Mildred Dane upon
her child, which was originally transmitted from Mildred
Dane's South American ancestors, and I no
longer envy Beatrix her beauty. Better be the ugliest
woman in the land than the thing she is! I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
exchange my plain face, were it ten times plainer, for
Beatrix Dane's glorious beauty. Mother, listen, and
do not faint or cry out. This is the bad, black secret:
Mildred Dane inherited the awful plague of leprosy,
and from her it descends to her child, Beatrix Dane!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BEATRIX HEARS THE SECRET.</p>


<p>Silence&mdash;awful silence! Beatrix could hear her own
heart beat as she stood there alone in the silence
and darkness of her own chamber, the hand that wears
Keith Kenyon's wedding-ring pressed against her
madly throbbing heart.</p>

<p>The full significance of the words to which she has
just listened does not reach her understanding. She
does not fully realize their awful meaning. Not now;
time enough for that later, when the numbness is gone
from her brain and she has the courage to stand face
to face with the bitter&mdash;the awful truth.</p>

<p>She stands staring straight before her into the darkness,
her hand pressing against her heart convulsively,
holding her breath to hear what may come next.</p>

<p>Serena's voice breaks the awful silence, low and hissing
like some venomous serpent.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;all true&mdash;true as gospel, mamma!" she
cried, exultantly. "There is no reason to doubt it&mdash;no
possibility of a mistake. It was the shock of discovering
the horrible truth that killed my father. You
know he just idolized Beatrix; and to find out that
for all these years he had been harboring an accursed
creature like that, whose very touch may be pollution&mdash;for
no one can tell when the disease may break out
in the system&mdash;simply killed him. Mamma, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
story is true; there is no doubt of it. This frightful
disease is transmitted from generation to generation,
and is incurable. But perhaps I had better read you
the letter. Mr. Demorest says that it is a terrible
revelation, which ought to be placed in the hands of
the authorities, for no leper should be allowed to go
at large in the streets of a city."</p>

<p>There was a ring of satisfaction in Serena's cold
voice. Truly, if "love is as strong as death," "jealousy
is as hard as hell," and knows no pity.</p>

<p>"But, Serena," Mrs. Lynne interposes, feebly,
"there is nothing to prove that this terrible disease has
developed in Beatrix. Her skin is as fair as a lily&mdash;a
wonderful complexion&mdash;"</p>

<p>Serena groaned. Complexion was her <i>bete noire</i>.
Hers was the color of a weak solution of coffee. Mrs.
Lynne went on:</p>

<p>"There is, in fact, as yet, nothing in the world to
make one put faith in the statement concerning Beatrix.
Don't let your jealous hatred of the girl lead
you astray. It will merely precipitate matters; and
you will have to prove all these things, you know,
Serena."</p>

<p>"Mamma you must think me an idiot. Of course,
I expect to prove all that I assert&mdash;at least, as much
as any one possibly can. We can only prove that
Mildred Dane&mdash;this girl's mother&mdash;was a victim of
the plague of leprosy; and any physician will tell you
that no child of a leper&mdash;especially when the leper is
a woman&mdash;can possibly escape the dark inheritance.
Sit down there in that arm-chair, mamma, and let me
read you the letter, the very letter that killed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
father. When he tossed it upon the fire, fate decreed
that it should not be consumed. Fortunately, the fire
was low, and papa must have been nearly dead when
he attempted to destroy the letter, and with it all evidence
of the awful curse which is Beatrix Dane's inheritance.
But I found the scorched fragments of the
letter&mdash;it was only torn in four pieces&mdash;and I put them
safely away in a little tin box. When we came down
here to New Orleans some impulse prompted me to
bring the box and contents with me. I had heard papa
speak of a Mr. Demorest in this city who was wonderfully
ingenious and successful in deciphering and
restoring old papers. I found his address upon a card
among papa's private papers, and I brought the card
with me when we came to this city. I had no difficulty
in finding the man. I knew that it would cost me a
pretty penny; so it did. It has taken every dollar that
I had in the world, but it is well invested. I am more
than repaid for the outlay; for, oh, mamma, Keith
Kenyon will never make Beatrix Dane his wife now&mdash;never!
Listen to me while I read you the letter. It is
from old Bernard Dane to my father, and this is what
it says."</p>

<p>Silence once more, broken by the rustling of paper
as Serena unfolds the fresh sheet upon which Mr.
Demorest has transcribed the contents of the mutilated
letter&mdash;the silence of the very grave reigns throughout
the old house. The girl in the other room has thrown
herself into a low seat, and crouches there like some
hunted creature brought to bay, her heart overflowing
with awful and bitter anguish&mdash;a suffering so intense
that no words have ever been framed in any language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
capable of expressing it. A cloud of horrible darkness
and despair envelopes her; she can see no ray of light;
she is groping in the gloom, still unable to fully comprehend
the nature of this wondrous horror that has
come into her life. She will realize it to its full extent
by and by.</p>

<p>Loud and clear, and with a ring of triumph in it,
Serena's voice falls upon the silence once more as she
reads that fatal letter aloud&mdash;reads to the bitter end.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doctor Frederick Lynne</span>,&mdash;I feel it is my duty,
now that Beatrix is grown and the time is coming for
me to remove her from your care, to reveal to you
the nature of the terrible future in store for her&mdash;the
dark inheritance which must inevitably descend
upon her sooner or later. You are a physician and a
scientific scholar, and you will comprehend and no
doubt feel intense interest in this strange and peculiar
case. Let me go back a generation or two. Mildred
Dane, the mother of Beatrix, was a Miss Baretta; her
parents were South Americans, and very strange and
eccentric people. They reared Mildred, who was an
only child, in the strictest privacy, and the girl grew
up in ignorance of the blight which was destined to be
cast upon her life. She was very beautiful, and very
sweet-tempered&mdash;too easily yielding to others. She
was forced by her parents into a distasteful marriage
with Godfrey Dane, an old man, but very wealthy.
One child was born, and Godfrey Dane died when it
was a few months old. That child was Beatrix&mdash;little
Beatrix who has lived with you all her life.</p>

<p>"I pass over Mildred's tragic death, and all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
events which do not bear directly upon the fate of this
child; it is with her alone I wish to deal. Dr. Lynne,
I am going to tell you all in as few words as possible.
Before her death, poor Mildred became a victim of
leprosy, and while her child was drawing from its
mother's breast the awful, incurable plague into its
system. That Beatrix will escape the scourge is simply
impossible.</p>

<p>"But it seldom makes its appearance before the age
of eighteen&mdash;it may be a little later or a little earlier,
but somewhere in the neighborhood of that age.</p>

<p>"So until she reaches eighteen there is no reason
to fear contagion to your family. I wish you to send
Beatrix to me at once; I would place her under the
care of an eminent physician, but all efforts will prove
unavailing; there is no hope for her; it is only a question
of time before the dread disease will develop in
her system. Send her to me at once. You will find a
letter accompanying this which will be explanation
enough for your family; but keep this letter as secret
as the grave. Never let Beatrix Dane catch a glimpse
of its contents, or the knowledge of what this letter
contains may kill her outright. And now I have made
a full explanation, I have no more to say. Send the
girl to me, and your responsibility ceases forever.</p>

<p class="sig1">
"Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="sig2">
"<span class="smcap">Bernard Dane</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Serena's voice rang out clear and distinct to the very
last. Then silence settled down, broken by Mrs.
Lynne.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!"&mdash;in an awe-stricken voice&mdash;"Serena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
this is horrible! Do you think there was any
danger while she was with us? Oh! what if we have
been exposed to this dreadful thing! I wish that girl
was dead&mdash;dead and buried and forgotten. I hate to
think of her."</p>

<p>And not a word of pity for the hopeless wretch who
was doomed to suffer from this awful curse; the heart-broken,
wild-eyed creature in the adjoining room, who
crouched in the depths of the arm-chair and listened&mdash;listened
eagerly, intently, to every word that Serena
had read in the fatal letter. Not a word, or a cry, or
a groan, passed Beatrix Dane's lips as she crouched
there, and over her a great darkness settled; life
drifted away from her grasp; the graceful head fell
forward, and she lost consciousness. It was merciful
oblivion; but it was destined not to last.</p>

<p>She lifted her head at length, and gazed wildly
about her in the darkness. No sound reached her
ears; the next room was as silent as the grave. Mrs.
Lynne and Serena had gone to their own apartments
to talk over the horrible story which had come into
their possession. Beatrix was left alone&mdash;alone!</p>

<p>Alas! she felt that she was fated to be alone henceforth
and forever&mdash;to grope among dead men's bones&mdash;to
live like the lepers of old in deserted tombs&mdash;to
be an outcast forever&mdash;accursed, shunned!</p>

<p>In olden times the leper was compelled to announce
his own approach, veiling his face from the gaze of
those not like himself accursed, and to cry aloud,
"Unclean! Unclean!"</p>

<p>Some faint fragments of history strayed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the girl's brain as she sat there, unable to realize as
yet the full depths of her own woe.</p>

<p>She had read of leprosy&mdash;the most horrible of all
known diseases, and which can never be cured. When
once the plague had appeared in her system, even her
very touch would be pollution.</p>

<p>Good God! she had kissed Keith's lips over and
over. What if&mdash;what if she had transmitted the curse
to him? Better for her to die than to bring this horrible
curse upon the man she loved!</p>

<p>She knew now, at last, the reason for her own isolation
in Bernard Dane's house. She must not mix
too intimately with other uncursed people, or they,
too, would become accursed.</p>

<p>Slowly, wearily, she arose to her feet and lighted
the lamp in her room. Then she went over to the
mirror and stood gazing upon her own face, her eyes
full of bitter woe. She could see no change there as
yet. The pearly skin was as fair and lovely as ever,
the beautiful dark eyes just as bright. She held up one
little hand and let the lamp-light gleam across it. It
was fair, and soft, and untainted. Yet all the same
the evil might lurk unseen, like a poisonous serpent,
in her blood, and when it became known it would be
too late&mdash;too late! And&mdash;oh, God in Heaven! was
there ever such a fate?&mdash;she was Keith Kenyon's
wedded wife. She had cursed his life; she had brought
ruin black and sure upon him; all his future happiness
was wrecked and destroyed.</p>

<p>"God pity me, I am lost&mdash;lost!" she moaned, bleakly.
And then with a low cry of anguish, the slight form
tottering weakly, she fell to the floor like one dead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">WORSE THAN DEATH.</p>


<p>Hours passed before Beatrix Dane returned to consciousness
and a realization of the truth. She lifted
her head and sat staring into the darkness, trying to
comprehend this awful thing that had come upon her
with all the force and harshness of a blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! what am I?" she groaned, in her
bitter anguish; "accursed! accursed!"</p>

<p>She arose and went over to the window and stood
there, with her burning cheek pressed against the pane,
her eyes fixed upon the darkness without. A dreary
scene. The wind had arisen, and went moaning
around the old mansion with a shrill, complaining cry
which sounded like some human creature in distress
and made the blood run cold in the poor girl's veins as
she listened. It sounded like a death-knell&mdash;the death-knell
of all hope for her. It seemed to say over and
over in a voice of dreary, mournful melody:</p>

<p>"Gone! hope, happiness, all gone! There is nothing
in life for you, poor wretch!"</p>

<p>She was Keith Kenyon's wife, and she had brought
a curse upon him&mdash;a curse which could never be lightened
or lifted. She was dead to him henceforth and
forever, even as she must now be dead to all hope in
life. One thought was ever before her, one duty was
plain to her: she must go away&mdash;go away out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
life forever&mdash;even though it should kill her to give
him up.</p>

<p>Where could she go? She thought of the cold
world to which she was comparatively a stranger, and
a shudder passed over her slender frame.</p>

<p>"I cannot stay here," she said, resolutely, trying to
be very brave and calm. "I must not expose other
people to possible contagion. I will go away and
leave Keith, and he will be free once more. But, oh,
if I had only learned this hideous secret before our
marriage, how much suffering we might have been
spared!"</p>

<p>She thought it all over&mdash;thought until her brain
reeled and her heart beat with great suffocating throbs
which nearly strangled her. Where could she go?
What door was open to receive such as she? Had the
awful plague really appeared, and declared itself in
her system, then she could find shelter in the hospital
where such poor wretches take refuge. She had heard
of such a place; the very thought of it was enough
to make her feel faint. But as yet there was no trace
of the terrible disease&mdash;no proof that she had really
become a victim to its horrors&mdash;there was only the
fact that her mother had transmitted to her offspring
the hideous plague which must sooner or later manifest
itself; and then horrible suffering, and at last inevitable
death. She wrung her hands with a moan
of bitter anguish.</p>

<p>"Was any one ever so accursed as I?" she cried,
desperately. "Oh, pitying Heaven! it is more than I
can bear!"</p>

<p>At last she made up her mind what to do. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
would leave Bernard Dane's house early in the morning.
She must not remain another day beneath this
roof. She would go direct to the hospital where that
hideous plague was treated&mdash;to the old physician who
had it in charge&mdash;and tell her pitiful story. Then she
would ask permission to remain there, and wait upon
the unfortunate creatures whose companionship she
must one day share. She would shut herself up in this
living tomb and wait for death to release her, because
there was no other shelter for such as she. No one
would dare to give her a home or extend a helping
hand to a wretch like Beatrix Dane. I suppose that
there never was another case like this in the world.
Young, beautiful, and accursed, wedded to the man
she idolized, and who in turn worshiped her as the
devotee worships the saint upon a shrine; all the world
before her, yet she must be set aside as a pariah, a horrible
thing to be shunned. Truly, "the sins of the
fathers shall be visited upon the children." The world
would be better and cleaner if that truth would be remembered
and taken to heart.</p>

<p>All night long the poor girl crouched in the darkness,
thinking, brooding over her unhappy fate. All
night long! What a night it was! It will never be
forgotten while poor Beatrix lives. How could she go
away like that, without a word of good-bye or a farewell
kiss to the husband so dearly loved? Oh, it was
horrible, horrible! Yet she must not risk his life by
touching his lips with hers. Perchance her own were
already polluted with the fiery wrath of the coming
plague, that curse which might be even now about to
declare itself, which must be, according to the theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of all authority upon that subject, even now dormant
in her system. She must not give way to woman's
weakness. She must go&mdash;go without a word or a look
or a touch. She must go out of Keith's life forever;
and in the days to come, perhaps when she was dead,
he would learn the hideous truth and pity her a little.
No matter though it killed her, she must not risk his
safety by a kiss. She must go&mdash;go alone; it was all
that was left for her to do.</p>

<p>She gathered together a few necessary garments
and packed them in a small hand-bag. Then she
wrote a few lines to Keith&mdash;to Keith, her love&mdash;this
man for whose dear sake she would gladly have laid
down her life, yet whom she was leaving forever&mdash;leaving
him, never again expecting to see him on earth.
She was as dead to him as though the coffin-lid had
closed over her and shut her out from the light of day&mdash;as
though she lay at rest under the sod. Surely no
woman ever had a harder task&mdash;an almost impossible
task like this to go through with!</p>

<p>When the first faint streaks of day began to appear
in the eastern sky, Beatrix took her small baggage and
stole from the room. On the table she left the letter
for Keith, sealed, and addressed to his name.</p>

<p>She stole noiselessly down-stairs and softly unfastened
the outer door. She passed forth, and Beatrix
Dane was homeless!</p>

<p>She glanced up at the old house lying hushed and
still under the shadow of the magnolias.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my husband," she moaned; "good-bye
forever! It is worse than death, the parting that divides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
us; but it must be borne. I am accursed&mdash;accursed!"</p>

<p>She pressed her lips against the hard oaken panel
of the door in a mute farewell. She had not dared
to go to the door of Keith's chamber, for fear that
he would hear her and all would be discovered. How
could she bear to tell him all just yet? How could
she tell him her sad, heart-breaking story, and see the
light die out of his eyes and the handsome face grow
pallid with suffering? No, she was not strong enough
yet to bear the ordeal. Better for her to go away
without seeing his face, perhaps never to see it again
while she lived. Yet she would have given her life
willingly for just one kiss from his dear lips. But
that can never be now. Never again can she look
into his dear eyes and hear him speak sweet, loving
words to her. Life was over and done with now, and
nothing was left but the darkness of the grave. And
she was so young to have all hope killed in her heart
like that!</p>

<p>She hastened away without another backward
glance, making a brave effort to be calm and face the
ordeal before her. The hospital was a long distance
away. She could not wait for the hour when the cars
would begin to run. She must walk it.</p>

<p>So she did. Faint and weary, not having eaten anything
since dinner the previous day, she walked all
that distance, and when at last she reached the hospital,
at its very door she fell to the ground in a dead
swoon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE NEXT DAY.</p>


<p>Keith awoke the next morning with a strange feeling
of peace and quiet in his heart&mdash;a sensation as though
he had anchored at last, and all his life would henceforth
lie through pleasant ways.</p>

<p>"My little wife!" he murmured, fondly. "I shall
go to Uncle Bernard this morning and tell him of the
step I have taken. I shall break the news of my marriage
to him at once and have it all over. Surely he
can not in his heart object, since that was once his
dearest wish&mdash;his pet scheme. I wonder why he
changed his mind in regard to the projected marriage
between Beatrix and myself," the young man went on
thoughtfully as he performed his toilet. "It is a mystery
to me. Yet Uncle Bernard is very eccentric, and
I need not be surprised at anything that he may do or
say. Oh! how happy we shall be&mdash;my darling and I!
And if Uncle Bernard is really displeased, I will take
her away, and we will find some pretty little cottage
down-town, and I will get a position somewhere and
work for my darling&mdash;my little wife!"</p>

<p>As the last words passed his lips his eyes fell upon
an object, the sight of which made him frown. He
was standing near the window, and the object which
had attracted his attention was Serena Lynne walking
in the grounds outside. She was dressed in black&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in deep black&mdash;and her face was very pale, and
wore upon it a look which Keith Kenyon had never
seen there before.</p>

<p>"I wonder when those women are going to leave?"
he exclaimed, half aloud. "I am tired of the sight of
them, and Serena is a bitter enemy of my darling; I
feel sure of that. Dear little Beatrix, how can any
one dislike her? She is the sweetest-tempered, gentlest
little girl in the whole round world!"</p>

<p>At breakfast he looked anxiously for Beatrix; but
there was no sign of her; she did not make her appearance.
Old Bernard Dane looked uneasy. He rang
the bell, and Mrs. Graves appeared.</p>

<p>"Send to Miss Dane's room," he commanded, "and
see if she is ill, or why she does not come to breakfast.
Beatrix is an early riser," he added, glancing at Keith.</p>

<p>"A very good trait," observed that young man,
promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure," intervened Serena, with a
sneer in her voice which she could not repress to save
her life. "Everything Beatrix does is perfection.
She has not a single fault!"</p>

<p>"Very true," responded Keith, gravely, looking the
irate lady directly in the face. "She certainly has
never been guilty of sneering over the absent or traducing
people behind their backs!"</p>

<p>Serena's face grew crimson over the reproof, which
was certainly well merited. She turned to Bernard
Dane.</p>

<p>"My mother and I expect to start for the North
to-morrow," she announced. "You have been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
kind to us, Mr. Dane, and we are very grateful. Our
business here is ended, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish. The door of the breakfast-room
was thrown open, and Mrs. Graves crossed the threshold,
looking as pale as if she had just seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dane, oh, Mr. Dane, Miss Beatrix is not here
and her bed was not slept in last night! Everything
in the room is as usual, only a small hand-bag and
some of her plainer clothing are missing. And, if you
please, sir, I found this upon the dressing-table."</p>

<p>This was the letter which poor Beatrix had left
there addressed to Keith Kenyon.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling with indefinable horror, Keith
broke the seal and read these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Keith</span>,&mdash;My own, I am going to leave you. With
all my heart and soul I love you, but I am going to
leave you forever. There is a reason&mdash;a bad, black,
bitter reason. I can not&mdash;dare not write or speak of
that now. You will know all too soon, and when you
know, your heart will break, as mine has. Do not seek
me; I shall be in the very last place that you will think
of searching for me. You would as soon think of
looking for me alive in the dark and dreary tomb as
in the place that is to be my hiding-place hereafter.
I have done no wrong, my darling, only in becoming
your wife. If I could I would devote all my life,
every moment of it, to you, and to making you happy;
but fate, cruel and relentless fate, has decreed otherwise,
and we must part, never to meet again on earth.
I love you with all my heart, but&mdash;good-bye. Yours,</p>

<p class="sig2">
"<span class="smcap">Beatrix</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>He read the letter over and over until he knew it
by heart, his face as white as the face of a dead man,
his eyes full of piteous suffering. Then he arose from
the table, the letter clinched in one cold hand, his
form shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard,"&mdash;in a low, tremulous voice&mdash;"may
I see you alone in the library?"</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane went straight over to the buffet
and poured a wine-glassful of brandy from a cut-glass
decanter which stood there. He held it to Keith's lips.</p>

<p>"Drink that, my boy," he said, in a kindly tone.
"You look done up. Now come to the library. I am
at your service."</p>

<p>As the door of the breakfast-room closed behind
the two, Serena's eyes met her mother's gaze, and a
smile of triumph coiled her thin lips.</p>

<p>"He leaves us out of the private conference," she
said in a cold, metallic voice, "and the foolish boy does
not dream that we know more about this mysterious
flitting than he does. Mamma, you look surprised.
Why, did you not know that when I read that letter
aloud to you last night, Beatrix Dane was in the next
room and heard every word? It is her sleeping-room,
and she was there, and heard every word that I read.
I meant that she should."</p>

<p>"Serena!"</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Lynne was horrified at this heartless announcement.</p>

<p>"It is true, mamma&mdash;as true as gospel!" she returned,
harshly. "It was the best way to let her
know; and it is quite time that she should know. I
have been sharp and shrewd, for I have nipped this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
affair between her and Keith in the bud. The day
will come when Keith will be grateful to me that he
found out everything before it was too late. He is
awfully cut up now, but he is a man, and men get
over such things in the course of time&mdash;some of
them in an exceedingly short time&mdash;and then he will
come back to me&mdash;back to the woman who has sympathized
with him through all his sorrows. One thing
troubles me, however. I would like to know what she
wrote him, how much she has told him, and all about
it. I must know!"</p>

<p>An hour later Serena encountered Keith Kenyon in
the entrance hall. At sight of his face she fell back
with a cry of horror. It was awfully ghastly, white,
and drawn and convulsed with suffering; his eyes were
dark and dilated; he shook like a decrepit old man.</p>

<p>"Oh, Keith!" she cried, pausing and laying her hand
on his arm, "what, in Heaven's name, is the matter?
Are you grieving over poor Beatrix? Well, she has
gone away, and it was all that she could do, poor
child! One can not help pitying her from the depths
of one's heart. Tell me, Keith, have you heard all?
Has Mr. Dane told you all the awful truth concerning
poor Beatrix?"</p>

<p>Keith bowed his head slowly, and a look of heart-break
crept into his eyes.</p>

<p>"He has told me all," he moaned, "and I&mdash;Oh, I
can not speak of it now!"</p>

<p>"But, Keith,"&mdash;her voice full of triumph which
she can not restrain&mdash;"you should be glad that you
found it out in time to prevent future sorrow to you
both."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes rested upon the woman's hard, cold face,
and he covered his own with his hands.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," he said in a voice which did
not sound like his own, "the warning came too late.
Beatrix and I were married yesterday, Serena; she is
my own dear wife."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SISTER ANGELA.</p>


<p>The moments came and went, and still that slight
figure lay upon the hospital steps, the small face as
white and rigid as though she were dead. It was very
early, and the old physician in charge had not yet made
his appearance at the hospital, and the wretched inmates
dared not venture forth into the street where
Beatrix Dane had fallen in that death-like swoon.</p>

<p>Six o'clock chimed forth from a distant steeple, and
the sun was lying warm and bright across the girl's
pallid face, when a light footstep sounded upon the
path, and a woman bent over the girl's prostrate figure&mdash;a
Sister of Charity&mdash;one of those good and holy
women who spend their lives in working for others
in His holy name, and who alone of all others keep
themselves "unspotted from the world."</p>

<p>The sister passing by, on her way to a certain charitable
institution, had caught sight of the girl lying
upon the hospital steps, and her gentle heart had
prompted her to stop and inquire what was the matter.
She stooped and peered eagerly into the girl's
beautiful white face. The great dark eyes were closed,
and she was, to all appearances, dead.</p>

<p>But Sister Angela had seen too much suffering in
her life&mdash;too many cases similar in some respects to
Beatrix Dane's, but not exactly like hers, for surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
there was never another such experience in the world.</p>

<p>Sister Angela uttered a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"The poor child! She is young and fair. She has
fainted from exhaustion, or what is more likely, she
is in deep trouble. Oh, yes, it is trouble that breaks
us down sooner than anything else! It is far worse
and more fatal in its effects than the most severe illness.
Sickness of the heart&mdash;ah, that is incurable!"</p>

<p>Sister Angela lifted the girl's head upon her breast,
and pushed aside the veil from the white face to give
her air. A faint sigh passed the poor girl's lips, and
consciousness seemed slowly struggling back to her.
She opened her sad, dark eyes, and they met the pitying
gaze of Sister Angela's blue ones.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" moaned the girl, lifting her head.
"Uncle Bernard&mdash;Keith&mdash;oh, my God!"</p>

<p>And the dreadful truth rushed over her memory
like a flood, and the golden head drooped once more,
and an awful pallor overspread the girlish face. Sister
Angela thought she was going to faint again.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said in her soft, persuasive voice,
"you are ill and in trouble. Tell me where to take
you. I will see you safely to your home and friends."</p>

<p>"Home?"&mdash;her voice full of bitterness&mdash;"I have no
home. Friends? Is there such a thing as a friend&mdash;a
real friend&mdash;in the whole world?"</p>

<p>"If we find none here on earth, there is always One
above us, my child," the sister answered, softly. "We
must turn to Him for comfort in our sorrow. Nobody
else can help us, believe me, dear."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Sister Angela; a Sister of Mercy, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mercy?" The girl's voice rang out in a bitter cry.
"There is no mercy, none, for such as I. Oh, sister&mdash;sister,
tell me what to do. I am a lost wretch, lost
forever. Not in the sense that you think," she added,
swiftly, noticing the expression which dawned upon
the calm face of the sister. "I have done no intentional
wrong, committed no crime; but I have married
a good man, and have brought ruin upon his whole
life. Listen to my story. It is brief. I married him,
and then afterward, when it was too late, I learned
that a dreadful fate is in store for me; that I am by
inheritance&mdash;a dark inheritance, indeed&mdash;tainted with
leprosy."</p>

<p>"My child!"</p>

<p>The sister's voice trembled perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Surely you do not realize what you are saying!"</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;all true," Beatrix went on swiftly. "I
heard the truth, the awful truth, under such circumstances
that I can not doubt it. And all the surroundings
of my daily life prove that my only relative knew
all the time the evil that threatened me, but for some
reason&mdash;perhaps through mistaken kindness, he failed
to let me know the worst. Sister, I am accursed!"</p>

<p>Sister Angela shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>"My dear, nobody is so accursed that the love and
pity of the Father of all can not reach them. But I
have had experience with this loathsome disease, and
I see no indications of it in you as yet. Suppose that
you come with me? My child, I do not advise you to
enter this hospital, if that was your intention. And
Doctor Davis will probably refuse to receive you, since
there are no signs of the disease visible upon you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
He would refuse you admittance; and, besides, the
daily sight of these poor wretches in this pest-house
would drive you mad. My dear, be advised by me.
I am used to suffering of all kinds, and I say come
with me, under my protection. I am attached to an
institution for the sick and suffering. You are far
from well; I will have you cared for, and when you
feel better you may assist me in the sick wards. There
is always work for willing hands and a strong young
body. And all the time we will watch you narrowly,
and when the dark day comes&mdash;if God sees fit that it
should come to you&mdash;and we discover that this awful
affliction has really befallen you, we will help you to
bear it. And then&mdash;not until then, you shall be sent
to this refuge. Will you take my advice?"</p>

<p>Beatrix lifted her tear-filled eyes to the saint-like
face.</p>

<p>"God must have sent you to me, sister," she sobbed.
"I will go with you, and may God forever bless you!"</p>

<p>She arose with some difficulty, for she was very
weak. The sister put her strong arm about the slender
waist, and taking Beatrix's hand-bag in the other hand,
led the girl away. As they turned their backs upon
the gloomy old building, Beatrix shuddered.</p>

<p>"I think it is no sin to pray that God will take me
away before I am doomed to enter there," she said,
softly.</p>

<p>Sister Angela sighed.</p>

<p>"We will hope for the best," she returned, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died on her lips.</p>

<p>Beatrix had come to a sudden pause, grasping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
sister's arm in a fierce grip, her eyes dilated with horror.</p>

<p>"See!" she panted, brokenly. "Must I&mdash;oh, pitying
Father!&mdash;must I ever be like that?"</p>

<p>They were passing the grounds that surrounded the
lepers' hospital, unkempt and straggling, with a mournful
air of melancholy pervading them. Of what use
to furnish pleasing sights to attract these doomed
wretches?</p>

<p>Accursed, accursed, with nothing to live for, and
small hope in the afterward! Peering at them with
curious eyes from behind a ragged clump of shrubbery,
a wild-looking creature stood, not many feet
away from them. It was a sight to be remembered
while Beatrix Dane had life. Good heavens! was that
horrible caricature of a human being alive? And yet,
this woman&mdash;for the creature resembled a woman&mdash;might
have been pretty some day, even as she had once
been young.</p>

<p>For a moment Beatrix stood like one petrified, an
awful horror in her eyes, which were riveted upon the
dreadful sight, her limbs shaking like an old person
with the palsy.</p>

<p>Sister Angela spoke at last in a low, trembling voice.</p>

<p>"My dear, I would not look at&mdash;at it," she said,
gently. "Do not fear. You will never be like that;
I am sure of it. That woman is old, and you, my
poor child! will not live to be old, I am sure of it,
after that affliction comes upon you. And, dear, only
think, God may have pity and take you away before
that time comes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Beatrix started, and a little hope flashed into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Sister, do you think that it would be very, very
wrong, under my peculiar circumstances, to&mdash;to take
my own life? I have nothing to live for."</p>

<p>"My dear!" Sister Angela's voice rang out in wild
distress. "Never think of such a thing again," she
cried. "Oh, believe me, my dear, you had better suffer
all the sorrows of this life, and bear all its burdens
in patience, knowing that, after the cross, the crown.
But suicide is an unpardonable sin in the eyes of God.
Never think of it again, my dear, I beg of you. Now,
lean on me and I will take you to the car; we will go
straight to the home to which I am taking you&mdash;a home
that God has provided for you. There you will find
rest for the present and work for the future, and God
will help you to bear your burden, my poor child."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SERENA'S NEW SCHEME.</p>


<p>If ever a man lived in the world with a broken heart,
Keith Kenyon was the man. He was utterly prostrated;
life seemed at an end to him; he had no hope,
no ambition. The woman he loved&mdash;his own dear
wife&mdash;was gone from him forever, and with an awful
curse resting upon her life, an inheritance of woe
which was liable to descend upon her head at any moment.
And she had gone from him, gone in all the
bitterness of her awful anguish out into the cold world&mdash;where?
He could not, dared not think. Suppose
that she had taken her life into her own hands? That
she was even now lying at the bottom of the Mississippi,
that great and mighty stream which has borne
away upon its ceaseless current so many of the heart-broken
creatures of this world, who, weary of life, and
tired of its heavy burdens, cast themselves into the
murky waters of the river, and their souls are hurried
before their Maker, there to account for the wrong-doing
of their lives.</p>

<p>At first Keith was in a sort of lethargy of despair.
He sat for hours in his room, never moving, never
looking up&mdash;sitting with his head upon his hand, buried
in deep thought, awful, anguish-stricken. To all
appearances he was dead to the things of this world,
and oblivious of all that was taking place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>In his own room old Bernard Dane lay upon a sick-bed;
he had given up and taken to his bed when the
news of Beatrix's disappearance was first announced,
and he seemed likely never to arise. The days went
by, and Mrs. Lynne and Serena still lingered at the
Dane mansion, which was in reality a house of mourning
now.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Graves was quite at her wits' end in all
this trouble, and she had begged the Lynnes to remain.
As this was just what Serena fully intended doing, it
was, of course, easily arranged.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day after Beatrix's flight
from the Dane mansion, Keith came into his uncle's
room, and sat down beside the bed.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bernard," he began, "I must try to find
her. The shock of her disappearance has been so great&mdash;so
overwhelming&mdash;that I have been benumbed. I
feel like one groping in the dark, but now I am awake,
and I see that the child may be in great danger. I
must search for her, and find her, if she is living; if
not&mdash;if she is dead&mdash;I will go away&mdash;away from
Louisiana forever."</p>

<p>The old man uttered a cry of distress.</p>

<p>"Keith! Keith, my boy!" he moaned. "You will
surely not do that? You would not go, and leave the
old man to die alone? Oh, Heaven! what have I done
that I should be punished so, and deserted in my old
age?"</p>

<p>The words touched Keith's heart, and made it ache.
He seized the old man's wrinkled hand and pressed it
warmly.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Bernard," he said, slowly, "I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
go and leave you&mdash;I will never leave you while you
live. But I must search for Beatrix&mdash;I must know
whether she is living or dead. If she is still alive, I
must know where she is, and she must be provided
for. You will help me, Uncle Bernard?"</p>

<p>"I will, my boy&mdash;I will, indeed. We will devote our
lives to that end. We have wasted precious time already.
Go at once, Keith. Ah, if I were well, and
able to accompany you!"</p>

<p>Keith left the house, his mind absorbed with the
one hope of finding his lost darling, poor, heart-broken
child! His first step was to insert advertisements in
all the daily papers&mdash;a few words.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beatrix, come home. No matter what may come,
I will protect you.</p>

<p class="sig2">
K."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>But, alas! poor Beatrix was destined never to see
the advertisements; and even had she seen them she
would not have obeyed the request, for she dared not
risk the lives of other people in that reckless fashion.
Keith's next step was to place the matter in the hands
of a skilled detective. Then, impelled by a strange
intuition, he visited the lepers' hospital. For well he
knew Beatrix Dane and her high-strung, sensitive nature;
and the conviction had crept into his heart that
she would fly to this refuge, believing herself accursed,
and intuition, as is apt to be the case, was correct in
this instance. Yet, as we already know, Keith was
destined to fail in his search.</p>

<p>The old physician in attendance at the hospital was,
of course, in perfect ignorance of the existence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Beatrix, and so relieved Keith's anxiety upon that
score, for it seemed to him that the knowledge that
Beatrix was incarcerated in that horrible place would
kill him outright.</p>

<p>He returned home heartsick and despairing, yet conscious
of a feeling of gratitude and relief that he had
not found her there. He repeated to old Bernard Dane
the result of his search, and the old man wept bitter
tears. He was very weak and childish now; all the
old harshness had disappeared forever, and he was
not at all like the hard-hearted old man he had been
so short a time ago.</p>

<p>"We must find her, Keith," he sobbed; "and I will
devote my life, what is left of it, to her care. I am
old, and my days will soon be ended here on earth;
but I can devote the remnant of my life to no higher
or better object than the care of this unfortunate child.
And when that awful affliction falls upon her, I will
be with her to help her to bear it. Oh, how wicked,
how cruel, how sinful I have been to her&mdash;my Mildred's
little child! Oh, will God ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>He wept like a weak woman, overcome with the full
weight of his sorrow and remorse. And in the midst
of his grief he found an unexpected comforter.</p>

<p>Keith having been summoned from his side, Serena
slipped softly into the room, and came to the old man's
bedside.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dane," she began, in a sympathetic tone, "let
me try to cheer you a little. Do not grieve over poor
lost Beatrix, poor child. We will find her and restore
her to her home; or&mdash;or&mdash;if the awful curse must
come upon her, we will do all in our power to alleviate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
her sufferings. Do not grieve so, Mr. Dane. Let me
bathe your head with cologne water, and do try and
sleep a little, will you not?"</p>

<p>The old man smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"You may do as you like," he made answer, "I am
completely prostrated."</p>

<p>So Serena went to work and bathed the old man's
throbbing temples, and made him comfortable. At
last his eyes closed, and his slow, regular breathing
announced that he was asleep. Serena's face wore a
look of triumph, and her pale blue eyes flashed with
exultation.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she muttered, low under her breath,
"why not? He is very rich and very old, and&mdash;I
must have money. And Keith will never care for me,
and he is married to that wretched girl who will be
a mill-stone about his neck while she lives, and she
may live many years. I am not sure but that I have
solved the problem for myself, and found a way&mdash;an
unexpected way&mdash;out of my difficulties. Keith's love&mdash;the
love of the only man on earth worth having&mdash;can
never be mine&mdash;never! It is useless to aspire, to
hope. But why should I spoil all my life for the sake
of a love that can never be mine? I will not do it!
I will put forth all efforts now to a special end, and
live henceforth for that one purpose. I must have
money. I will marry old Bernard Dane, and be rich,
and"&mdash;her pale eyes shining like glass&mdash;"I will thus
control the fortune which Keith Kenyon expects to
inherit. Oh, it will be a game worth playing; and I
will play it, even though I am destined to be beaten at
the game!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an idea worthy of the brain from which it
emanated, and a scheme which would not have occurred
to any one else. Serena was desperate. She
had lost her game; but money she must have, and she
had devised a scheme by which to secure it. It was
not an original idea, but there was no reason why it
should not succeed; for old Bernard Dane was completely
broken down now&mdash;a perfect wreck&mdash;a mere
ghost of the aggressive old man who had been guilty
of plotting, as he had done, against the life and happiness
of the two who, after all, he held most dear.
Sorely he was being punished&mdash;severely, fearfully
punished&mdash;for his wicked scheme to marry those two
young people, when he believed that only ruin could
come of the marriage. Ah! believe me, we who sin
must suffer for our sins. I think that old Bernard
Dane realized this truth at last.</p>

<p>And so Serena laid her plot, and went to work with
a will. She must have money, for her funds were
nearly exhausted, and her mother was not much better
off. Real poverty stared them in the face. And here,
right before her, was the possibility of retrieving her
fallen fortunes and securing a grand home for herself
and her mother.</p>

<p>And better than all else&mdash;to a narrow nature like
hers&mdash;it would be opening a road to the ruin of Keith
Kenyon, and to wreak upon him a dire and speedy
vengeance. He would not love her; he would not
make her his wife; he had discarded her for the pretty
face of another woman; had cast her off coldly. Well,
she would marry old Bernard Dane and possess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
great Dane fortune. Then Mr. Keith Kenyon might
look out for himself. To a nature like Serena Lynne's,
this was a glorious triumph.</p>

<p>She little dreamed how, in the dark days to come,
she would bitterly regret having ever made this decision.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">AN UNEXPECTED DECLARATION.</p>


<p>In a white bed in a darkened room at the institution
to which Sister Angela belonged, poor Beatrix lay
moaning and tossing in pain. For she was stricken
down with brain fever, and there seemed to be small
hope of her recovery.</p>

<p>She had not told Sister Angela her name, therefore
no one at the institution was able to identify her;
and although the physician in charge of Beatrix saw
the advertisement which Keith had inserted in the
newspapers, how could he guess that the Beatrix who
was implored to return to K was the very patient in
whom the physician was becoming strangely interested?
All that he did know concerning her history
was what Sister Angela had repeated to him; and of
course the information was meager enough; for in
her misery poor Beatrix had not felt inclined to confide
absolutely. But the physician saw for himself how
beautiful the girl was, and that she was a refined and
delicate lady, and his interest grew and flourished.</p>

<p>Sister Angela confided in Doctor Darrow the outlines
of the girl's case as far as she herself knew, that
is, in regard to her strange inheritance. Doctor Darrow's
face grew pale as death, and his gray eyes dilated
with horror until they were as dark as night.</p>

<p>"It can not be possible!" he exclaimed. "It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
incredible! We will keep her secluded from every
one else here, and I will study her case in my spare
moments. You are aware that I am devoting myself
to the study of this horrible disease, and this will be a
grand opportunity to test some of my theories in regard
to the matter. Heaven help her, poor child!
And she is so young and beautiful. I wonder where
her home is, and who she is?"</p>

<p>But Beatrix, in her delirium, raved in such incoherent
phrases that no one could find a clew to her
identity, her name, or former home. It was all about
the sorrow of a parting&mdash;a parting from some loved
one&mdash;which she expressed in her wild ravings; and
although Douglas Darrow passed nearly all his time
at her bedside, he could find nothing tangible to guide
him in a search for the friends of the unfortunate
girl. Douglas Darrow was young and handsome&mdash;an
enthusiast in his profession; he was all alone in the
world, and the possessor of a fair fortune. He grew
deeply interested in his mysterious patient, and ere
he had realized the truth he found himself crossing
the boundary that separates friendly interest from the
fatal passion of love. But poor Beatrix, tossing in
wild delirium upon her white bed, was deaf and blind
to everything around her. To human eyes it seemed
better for her to pass away now, and drift down the
dark river of death into the great unknown. But
the Father, who guides and directs us, had His own
plans for her future, and so poor Beatrix did not die.</p>

<p>She struggled back to consciousness one day, and as
the great dark eyes opened slowly they fell upon the
face of Doctor Darrow, who was seated at her bedside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keith!" she faltered, trying to arise, but the effort
was too much, and her head fell back upon the pillow
and she fainted away. Her constitution seemed entirely
broken down, and her long illness, preceded by
that awful shock which had ruined her whole life,
had left her weak to bear the heavy burden. Douglas
Darrow soon restored her to consciousness, and administered
a sleeping potion. She sank, at last, into a
refreshing slumber, and the young physician began to
hope that she might be saved.</p>

<p>"If she awakens in her senses, with her reason unclouded,"
he said to Sister Angela, who stood gazing
sadly down upon the weak little sufferer, "she will
recover, I think&mdash;I am positive. But she must not
have the least excitement; no questions must be asked
her; she must not be annoyed in any way, or we will
not be able to save her. Yet, after all," he went on
tremulously, "it seems better that she should go now.
Only think of the future in store for her!"</p>

<p>"Our Father in Heaven knows best," returned Sister
Angela, softly; "we can afford to leave it all in
His hands."</p>

<p>The young man turned aside with something like a
sob.</p>

<p>"You are an angel!" he cried. "The world would
be purer and better if there were more women like
you."</p>

<p>When one looks about and sees the women of the
world&mdash;the fashion-plates and simpering dolls of society&mdash;then
turns to the pure white lives of those like
Sister Angela, one can not fail to echo Douglas Darrow's
words: "To visit the fatherless and the widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
in their affliction, and to keep ourselves unspotted
from the world." This was Sister Angela.</p>

<p>But with all her prudence and forethought, Sister
Angela had forgotten to mention to the young physician
the fact of Beatrix's marriage. And looking at
the girl so young and childish, no one would be surprised
that the fact had escaped her memory. And
Sister Angela never once, in her unworldliness, remembered
the proneness of young men to fall in love,
and that love comes when least expected, and is as
speedy of growth, ofttimes, as was Jonah's gourd, and,
alas! sometimes withers as soon.</p>

<p>Beautiful, ephemeral love! Well, without it, life
would be dreary enough, and surely it is given to mortals
as a foretaste of Paradise, only there love will
live without "the immeasurable sadness which it too
often has on earth."</p>

<p>Slowly Beatrix recovered. She felt no desire to
live, for what was there to live for on earth? But as
is so often the case when a sick person cares little for
life, she grew daily stronger and better. Sister Angela
was a devoted nurse, and Doctor Darrow seemed
only to exist in Beatrix's presence, yet all that he
knew of her history was that her name was Beatrix.</p>

<p>When at last she was able to sit up and amuse herself,
one of the attendants brought her some magazines,
wrapped in a copy of one of the daily papers&mdash;now
a month old. Beatrix turned the paper over with
listless fingers, and was about to lay it aside when her
eyes fell upon a notice&mdash;the very advertisement which
Keith had inserted. With wild, dilated eyes Beatrix
read the advertisement to the end; then, with a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
cry, she bowed her head upon her hands and burst
into tears. There was the sound of a firm footstep;
a moment later Douglas Darrow bent over her and
took her wasted form in his arms.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, Beatrix!" he whispered, "look up and
hear what I have to say. You must not shed tears,
my beautiful darling! Oh, Beatrix, I love you so!
Come to me, and be my wife. I can not live without
you! I will shield you from all ill, and if suffering
must come upon you, I will devote my life trying to
alleviate your suffering. Tell me, Beatrix, will you
try to care for me? I am twenty-eight years old, but
I have never really loved any woman before; and I
would lay down my life to call you mine. Answer me,
darling; will you try to love me a little?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED.</p>


<p>For a moment it seemed to Beatrix that she could
not have heard aright. Her brain was giddy, her
breath came fluttering feebly&mdash;she looked as if she
was going to swoon.</p>

<p>Doctor Darrow's practiced eye marked the change
in his patient at once, and he started with a low cry
of alarm.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed, wildly, "what have
I done? Oh, Beatrix! Beatrix! do not mind me. I
was mad to speak to you of such things now when
you are so weak and ill! Forgive me, darling. I will
not err in that way again. I promise not to refer to
the subject again until you are strong enough to listen."</p>

<p>A faint shudder passed over the sick girl's wasted
frame, her eyes shone like stars; but she had made up
her mind in a moment that, no matter how it might
excite her and retard her recovery, she must speak
out now and tell him all&mdash;this good, kind heart, this
truly noble man who was willing to devote his life
to her service, yet knew all her dread secret! And
yet how little could he do&mdash;could any human being do&mdash;to
help her!</p>

<p>"Doctor Darrow," she said, laying her little wasted
hand upon his arm, "I must speak now. I must tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
you the truth and prevent any further misunderstanding.
You must not speak to me of love or marriage.
Even&mdash;even if I were not the afflicted creature that I
am, it is wrong, it is sinful to do so; for&mdash;I am the
wife of another man!"</p>

<p>He started with a low cry, biting his lip until the
blood came. All the color faded from his face, and
his gray eyes grew black as night with anguish. He
turned aside, as though to leave the room; then he
came back to the window near which Beatrix was sitting,
and sank upon a sofa that stood near. The room
was as still as death. He could not collect his thoughts
enough to speak. He sat trembling like a leaf. At
last:</p>

<p>"I beg you to forgive me," he said, in a shaking
voice. "I had no right to speak of such things to you
until I had first learned you were free. Of course,
no one looking at a child like you would imagine that
you were a married woman. I never thought of such
a thing. You know that I meant no insult, Beatrix?"</p>

<p>Her great, dark eyes met his gaze with a look of
earnest gratitude.</p>

<p>"You? Why, you have saved my life, though that
life is not, perhaps, worth saving," she added, sadly.
"Oh, Doctor Darrow, you have been so good and
kind to me! I can never thank you enough! But,
of course, this of which you speak can never be. If
you wish, I will tell you my sad story."</p>

<p>"I would be grateful for your confidence," he returned,
"and will guard it as sacred. I wish I could
help you in this awful trouble. I can only watch you
well and study your case, to which I promise to devote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
all my faculties. I have devoted much of my
time to the study of this strange disease and the tests
by which its existence in the system is first detected
and proven. Ah, well!"&mdash;he rose as he spoke, stifling
a weary sigh&mdash;"at least I shall have that one object
left in life. It is something worth living for."</p>

<p>He left the room, and Beatrix was alone with her
own dreary thoughts.</p>

<p>All the future looked dark and dismal enough, and
it seemed to the poor girl that there could never again
be a ray of light to shine upon her darkened pathway&mdash;never
any more.</p>

<p>She bowed her head and wept bitter tears; but somehow
they seemed to relieve her, and after a time she
felt stronger and better.</p>

<p>Here Sister Angela found her, and sat down to
converse with the sick girl upon the affairs of the institution,
speaking to her of cases where the patients
suffered more in mind than body, and trying her best
to interest Beatrix in these poor creatures.</p>

<p>"As soon as you are strong enough, my dear," the
good sister said, gently, "we will take you into the
different wards and let you see how people suffer and
still live. There is nothing better to cure one of
mourning and repining over one's own sad fate&mdash;the
sorrow which is inevitable&mdash;than to witness the
sorrow of others, and to help the helpless to bear
their heavy burdens. Oh, Beatrix! truly that is worth
living for&mdash;a comforter! Blessed are the comforters!"</p>

<p>Beatrix lifted her head and taking the sister's hand,
pressed it warmly. Her sad heart was somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
strengthened, and she made up her mind to try and
bear her burden bravely, and in helping others, and
comforting and caring for those who were sick and in
distress, she would find her life work.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Beatrix was pronounced able to
go into the sick wards as assistant to the trained
nurses, waiting upon them and obeying their instructions.</p>

<p>Once accustomed to the routine, to the strange, sad
sights and sounds, Beatrix gave her whole attention
to it. She threw all her heart and strength and energy
into the task before her&mdash;the work which God had
placed in her hands to stand between her and despair&mdash;and
devoted herself to the noble work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime, at the old Dane mansion, Serena
was working hard to attain the desire of her heart.
She had made up her mind to become Mrs. Bernard
Dane, if it were within the power of a human being
to accomplish it, and to that end she labored industriously
and assiduously. She made herself so necessary
to the sick man's comfort that old Bernard Dane
soon began to think that he had judged her too
harshly, and that there was some good in Serena after
all. She was constantly at his bed-side. Of course,
her mother and Mrs. Graves both shared her task, for
the proprieties must be observed. But still Serena
was the real head of the house, and to her the others
began, after a time, to look for direction. And now
the managing part of Serena's nature became manifest.
She proved a splendid business and household directress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and Bernard Dane began to look up to her with
a feeling of admiration, and to declare that she was
a very superior woman.</p>

<p>Poor Keith, never dreaming of the contingency
which was looming up in the near future, went about
the house with a listless, preoccupied air, his face pale
and troubled, his eyes wearing a look of heart-break.
He paid no heed to the palpable scheme which Serena
had formed, and which was apparently on the road to
success&mdash;the game which was being played before his
very eyes&mdash;for he had too much else to think about,
and his own sorrow occupied him to the exclusion of
all else. But Mrs. Graves had her eyes opened suddenly
one day. She entered the sick-room in haste
on some necessary errand, and found Serena kneeling
at the bedside, her eyes fixed upon the old man's ugly
face with a rapt, eager look.</p>

<p>"I have thought a great deal of you ever since we
first met," Serena was saying, and the old housekeeper
caught the words as she crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," returned the old man, hastily, "but
I am too old to think of marriage now. Serena, we
will not discuss that at present."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>Serena arose to her feet with an air of resignation,
then turning sharply about, she encountered Mrs.
Graves.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Serena, harshly.</p>

<p>The old woman's face wore a look of angry displeasure.</p>

<p>"I came here on business with Mr. Dane," she returned,
coldly, "not with you. I beg your pardon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Miss Lynne, but I really do think that you are overreaching
yourself somewhat, and playing a dangerous
game. But it will be useless here," she added, freezingly,
"for Mr. Dane is a man of good sense, although
he is old and feeble."</p>

<p>Serena made no reply. She did not wish to provoke
a controversy right there, in the presence of the old
man; for then, of course, her plot would miscarry&mdash;her
well-laid scheme be doubtless brought to grief&mdash;and
her case was growing more desperate day by day.</p>

<p>The old home in Massachusetts had finally been
sold, and the small amount which remained over, after
all the debts were settled, was meager enough to make
Serena's heart contract with slow horror at the thought
of a possible old age in some alms-house, and Mrs.
Lynne lived in daily and hourly dread of the day
that would see them utterly penniless.</p>

<p>Time went on, and Serena tried to keep up heart
and courage, and worked hard at her well-formed
scheme of besieging the old man's heart.</p>

<p>But it was a difficult task for her to hope to reach
that heart, incrusted as it was with worldliness, selfishness,
and hardness&mdash;a real Chinese puzzle to Serena&mdash;but,
with a zeal worthy of a better cause, she kept
on in the road which she had marked out for herself.</p>

<p>She had succeeded in making her presence indispensable
to Bernard Dane. He had long since learned
to rely upon her, and to look to her for advice and
comfort, to soothe his sufferings and to cheer and
console him in his dreary moments. In short, she
had, with the greatest tact and skill, made herself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
regular sunbeam in the darksome sick-chamber, a ray
of sunlight to brighten the old man's gloom; and more
than all&mdash;a sure road to the heart of a man&mdash;she had
made herself a household necessity.</p>

<p>Just when she had succeeded in making herself indispensable
to Bernard Dane, just when he grew to
expect her coming to cheer his dreary sick-room,
when he began to rely upon her as a watcher, a gentle,
tireless nurse&mdash;Serena was a born nurse&mdash;when he had
begun to believe that there was no comfort in the
whole world for him which Serena's hand could not
bestow, when he had come to a stage where he would
miss the caressing touch of her gentle hands bathing
his brow and arranging his pillow, the voice which had
lost its shrill tones and now spoke only in a low, sweet
way, when he, in short, had begun to look to Serena
for every comfort, then&mdash;then came a blank, a dull,
dreary blank, for Serena suddenly disappeared. And
when the old man in querulous tones demanded of his
housekeeper the cause of her absence, Mrs. Graves
informed him that Serena, worn out with watching
and nursing, was very ill and confined to her own
room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A WELL LAID PLOT.</p>


<p>Two or three days dragged by. They seemed to
poor old Bernard Dane, lying upon his bed of suffering,
to really drag, they were so long and uneventful.
Every morning the first question asked Mrs. Graves
was: "How is Serena?" And Mrs. Graves would
wisely stifle her righteous wrath and answer quietly:</p>

<p>"About the same, sir."</p>

<p>The old man's anxiety as well as loneliness grew
and flourished. It would have retarded his recovery
but that he became suddenly possessed with a determination
to get well, and as his illness had really
been more due to sorrow and remorse than to any
bodily ailment, he was soon able to sit up and at last,
wrapped in a dressing-gown, reclined upon a sofa in
his large, cheerful room. He took care to send
friendly messages to Serena every day, and eagerly
waited for the time when she would be able to return
to him. It was true, strange as it may appear,
that old Bernard Dane, wise and astute, clever and
shrewd, had actually fallen in love with shrewish,
plain-faced Serena Lynne.</p>

<p>Wonders will never cease in this strange old world
of ours, and the very last thing down on the cards
had befallen old Bernard Dane. And yet it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
so wonderful, after all. Give any clever, designing
woman the opportunities that Serena possessed, and
my word for it, she will succeed though she be as
ugly as original sin and as shrewish as a virago. And
so Serena won the old man's heart, hard, ossified
though it was&mdash;won it by her kindly attentions, and
the way in which she posed before him as an ardent
admirer of his many sterling qualities.</p>

<p>The old man grew more impatient every day over
her continued absence, but he was compelled to content
himself with sending messages to Serena, and
ordering all sorts of dainties to be carried to her room.</p>

<p>So the days went by, and Serena had been out of his
sight for a whole week; and then, one morning, she
made her appearance once more in Bernard Dane's
sick-room. The old man, wrapped in his dressing-gown,
was seated in an easy-chair at the window, his
eyes fixed upon the scene without, a look of sadness
resting upon his face&mdash;very pale and worn.</p>

<p>At sound of the closing door he turned, and as his
eyes fell upon Serena, his wrinkled face lighted up
with a flash of joy. He started as though to arise,
but he was still quite weak, and he fell back upon the
cushions once more.</p>

<p>"Serena!" he exclaimed, "is it really you?"</p>

<p>She had really been ill, but not enough to cause
so long an exile from the sick-room; only that had
been a part of the game&mdash;her game, which seemed
destined to prove a grand success.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that you are able to be up!" she
cried, as she laid her hands in his.</p>

<p>Her face was very pale, and its pallor was enhanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
by a skillful application of pearl powder, while
dark circles, artistically laid on beneath her eyes, increased
the appearance of illness. She wore a flowing
wrapper of pale blue cashmere, and altogether,
Serena, who had studied the effect long and earnestly,
was looking her best, and she knew it.</p>

<p>She sank in a low rocker at his side, and began to
question him as to the care that he had received during
her enforced absence from the sick-room.</p>

<p>He answered all her inquiries with real tenderness
in his voice, and really the old man was inexpressively
touched at the thought that some one cared for him,
and surely, lonely and old as he was, this could not
be wondered at.</p>

<p>They conversed together for a time upon indifferent
topics and then silence gradually settled down, broken
in an unexpected way&mdash;Serena bowed her head upon
her clasped hands and began to weep softly, to all
appearance repressing her emotion by a great effort.</p>

<p>The old man caught the sound of her stifled sobs,
and uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>"Serena! Good heavens, child!" he exclaimed, in
a tone of alarm, "what is the matter? Why are you
crying? Lift your head, my dear, and look me in the
eyes."</p>

<p>She obeyed him, dabbing her eyes with her lace-bordered
handkerchief as she did so, as though in
shame and confusion at being detected in such weakness
as this.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she faltered, brokenly. "I am
going away&mdash;that is all. I ought to have gone long
ago, but&mdash;I could not leave you so ill and uncared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
for; and then I was taken ill myself. And I&mdash;I think
it best that I should leave here at once; for I have
learned to&mdash;to care too much for you, Mr. Dane. This
feeling must be conquered."</p>

<p>"Serena, I did not believe that your expressed affection
for me could be anything serious."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Dane!"</p>

<p>She lifted her pale blue eyes to his face with a swift
look of entreaty, then they drooped again.</p>

<p>"Serena, do you wish to leave me?" he asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, no, I do not! I would not go if I could help
it," she sobbed. "But I can not stay in this way, Mr.
Dane. It is not proper. I am an unmarried woman,
and you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am old enough to be your father!" he exclaimed;
"but, Serena, old as I am, my heart is young. Life
is a dreary waste to me&mdash;alone. Serena, will you
marry me?"</p>

<p>It was said; the words for which Serena Lynne had
listened and hoped for so long, the magic words which
would change all her life for her; the question was
asked at last for which she had schemed and plotted,
and which she sometimes had despaired of ever hearing;
the question whose answer would bring her
wealth, a grand home, and an honored name. She
caught her breath with a tremulous gasp, and one
hand pressed her heart convulsively.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dane," she cried, "you do not mean it! You
should not trifle with a lonely woman; it is cruel, unkind."</p>

<p>And she knew perfectly well, artful Serena, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
this delicate flattery would be the very shortest cut
to the old man's heart; that to imply his possession of
the powers of attracting and winning the admiration
of women would be the surest road to Bernard Dane's
affections. In short, by appealing to his masculine
vanity, guileless Serena hoped to gain her desire. She
laid her hand upon his arm as she spoke, and pressed
it gently. The old man's eyes rested upon her pale,
sad face, which for once wore a look of gentle tenderness,
which made her appear essentially womanly in
the old man's eyes. He lifted her hand and pressed
it to his lips.</p>

<p>"I mean it, of course," he returned, in a faltering
voice. "I have not cared for any one in years, but
your kindness has opened my heart and made me feel
that there is something on earth worth living for. I
ask you once more, Serena, in all honor, will you be
my wife? Marry me at once, and we will go abroad
for a time; for nothing can be done for poor Beatrix
by staying here; and Keith's life, poor boy, is ruined.
Will you be my wife, Serena?"</p>

<p>She bowed her head, and one little, potent word of
three letters was spoken&mdash;a word which made Serena
Lynne the promised wife of old Bernard Dane.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">KEITH HEARS THE NEWS.</p>


<p>Once decided in his course, old Bernard Dane was
not the man to turn back, or to express regret for
what he had done. The die was cast. He had asked
Serena Lynne to be his wife, and he would make her
Mrs. Dane, no matter what obstacles stood in the
way. Keith wandered about the house, looking like
a ghost, his mind so absorbed in the disappearance of
Beatrix that he had no thought for anything else, and
did not, therefore, perceive the state of affairs between
Bernard Dane and Serena. Mrs. Graves would have
attempted to put him on the track of that which the
good old lady saw was about to take place, for she
alone had kept her eyes open and seen the true state
of affairs, but she shrank from being the one to call
Keith's attention to the fact, and so no one spoke, and
Keith remained in utter ignorance.</p>

<p>Serena at once began preparations for the marriage.
She had decided that it must be soon&mdash;at once.</p>

<p>Bernard Dane allowed himself to be persuaded; and
so, all preliminaries having been gone through with, a
clergyman was engaged to perform the ceremony one
April eve. But first there remained the task of breaking
the news to Keith.</p>

<p>"I can't do it, Serena," the old man declared, childishly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"He will be so surprised&mdash;so shocked! You
must tell him yourself."</p>

<p>Serena's pale eyes flashed. That was just what she
wished to do. She felt a strange satisfaction in wounding
this man who had scorned her, and whose fortune
she was now about to usurp.</p>

<p>"Very well," she made answer, her pale face growing
livid as she spoke; "I will break the news to Keith
Kenyon."</p>

<p>She left the room at once, and went up to her own
apartment, there to stand for a few moments before
the mirror, while she scanned, with true feminine
criticism, the details of her own toilet.</p>

<p>She was looking very well in pale lavender muslin&mdash;she
had discarded mourning&mdash;with a bunch of pansies
in the yellow lace which covered the corsage. Her
dull flaxen hair was in a Psyche knot, and fell in a
fringe upon her brow. There was a glitter of cruel
triumph in her eyes, and she caught her breath with a
low cry of exultation.</p>

<p>"Serena, you are a trump!" she exclaimed, apostrophizing
her own reflection. "Beauty is well enough to
possess, but a clever woman can overreach mere
beauty any day. Well, I will go now to the library&mdash;Simons
says that Keith is there&mdash;and break my important
news to that gentleman. But&mdash;oh! Keith!
Keith!"</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands for a moment.
Not another word passed her lips, but that one wild,
agonized cry revealed the bitter truth that, come what
would, she had not forgotten Keith Kenyon, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
not ceased to love him. It was the one mad passion
of her narrow, empty life.</p>

<p>She left the room and went down-stairs straight to
the library. The door was closed. She rapped lightly
upon it.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called Keith's voice; and she turned
the knob and entered the room.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset; the slant rays of gold which
marked the road taken by the departing god of day
streamed in at the open window and across the bowed
head of the young man seated at the desk, his eyes
fixed upon the western sky with a hopeless look in
their depths. At sight of Serena he started up and
his face grew paler than before.</p>

<p>"Any news?" he asked, swiftly. "Serena, have you
heard anything of&mdash;of Beatrix? Have you come to
tell me that she is found?"</p>

<p>Serena stopped short, suppressing an exclamation
of disgust. Always Beatrix&mdash;always Beatrix! Never
any thought of her&mdash;and there never would be. She
drew a little nearer the desk where he was sitting,
and turned her face away, that he might not be able to
read its expression.</p>

<p>"No,"&mdash;trying in vain to keep the harshness out of
her voice&mdash;"I have no news of Beatrix. She has
probably taken her own life; and if that be true, would
it not be better, Keith?"</p>

<p>He started to his feet, then sank back wearily once
more.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he panted, fiercely; "it would not! Nothing
can ever make up to me for her loss&mdash;nothing!
She is gone, and the light of my life has gone with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
her. I shall never be happy again. I am utterly and
forever alone!"</p>

<p>Serena laid her hand upon his arm and lifted her
white, set face to his.</p>

<p>"Whose fault is it that you are all alone?" she demanded,
madly. "I would have died to make you
happy, Keith; but you would not. You scorned me&mdash;scorned
my love, and I&mdash;I have given up all hope of
ever winning a kindly feeling from you; so I have
done the best for myself that I can. Keith, are you
listening? I come here this evening&mdash;I have intruded
upon your solitude to tell you a piece of news which
concerns me alone, but in which you may be interested.
Keith, I am going to be married."</p>

<p>He started and pushed back the heavy hair from
his brow with an impatient touch; into his dark eyes
a look of satisfaction stole. It was plain to be seen
that he felt no regret for the fact of Miss Lynne's intended
marriage.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" he returned, trying to show some interest.
"Well, Serena, I am sure you have my best
wishes. When is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Tonight."</p>

<p>"What? Is it possible? I thought, of course, that
the happy bridegroom would be some one from the
North. Perhaps he has come here to New Orleans to
win his bride. Tell me all about it, Serena."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are interested at last. No, Keith, my
intended husband does not come from the North; he
lives here in New Orleans. In short,"&mdash;gazing full
into the young man's pale, handsome face, with eyes
full of exultation and a triumph which he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
fail to perceive&mdash;"I am going to marry Mr. Bernard
Dane."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Keith sprang to his feet, with a cry of astonishment
and dismay, his face pale as marble, his eyes full of a
dawning terror, and something which for a moment
made Serena afraid.</p>

<p>"Be good enough to explain," he said, at last, after
a long silence.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to say. I am going to
marry Mr. Bernard Dane tonight at eight. He is old,
but I must have a home and protector, and he has
asked me to marry him. The marriage will be solemnized
in two hours' time. That is all that I have to
say. Good-night, Keith."</p>

<p>But before she could leave the room he had opened
the door and strode over the threshold. Out to the
stables he went, his face set and stern and white as
death, his eyes full of darkness. He understood at
last her plot of vengeance&mdash;knew it now when it was
too late. It was the utter overthrow of all his hopes
and ambitions. He would be homeless, friendless; for
how could he expect Bernard Dane to make him his
heir now, when he would have a wife and perhaps
children to inherit his wealth?</p>

<p>Keith Kenyon had never been a money-worshiper;
but he had fully realized the importance of wealth and
position, and he had been reared to believe himself
Bernard Dane's heir. It seemed to him now that the
end of the world had come.</p>

<p>He entered the stables and ordered his horse saddled.
It was a new purchase, a splendid thoroughbred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
black as night, and well named Satan. In his
mad desire for excitement, Keith believed that he
could quench the fire which was burning in his brain.
He sprang into the saddle when the groom led Satan
forth, and whirled madly away, flying like the wind.
On he went through the most unfrequented streets of
the city. On, on, the horse growing wilder and more
ungovernable every moment. In the lower part of
the city it came to grief. Foam-flecked, wild-eyed, it
dashed into a narrow, stone-paved street and threw its
rider violently to the ground, upon the sharp paving-stones.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BEATRIX SEES THE GAME.</p>


<p>They were very busy that day in the ward of hopeless
cases. Beatrix had not had a moment to rest.
All day long the tired little feet were running here and
there in obedience to the nurse's call, the deft fingers
rolled bandages, smoothed fever-scorched pillows,
bathed throbbing temples, held cooling drinks to fever-parched
lips; in short, accomplished the one thousand
and one acts which soothe the sufferer and comfort
even the dying. The office of nurse is truly a grand
one. What more noble position can a woman fill than
that of comforter and consoler, to help ease the pain
of serious illness, and, if it can not be assuaged, to do
all that human power can do to help the poor sufferer
bear the awful suffering that is his doom! So Beatrix,
feeling that she had found her life-work, found
it in this strange way, and at the very crisis of her
life, when she had been on the point of despairing,
feeling that, at all events, she had found employment
for the present, which would help to deaden her pain,
worked away with a will, and was soon looked upon
as one of the most efficient and willing assistants attached
to the Home.</p>

<p>Today they had been overworked, for there had
been an accident&mdash;a falling building had crushed and
mangled several poor creatures a few blocks away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and a number of the sufferers had been carried to the
Home, there to linger for a time in awful agony and
then pass away. Beatrix grew heart-sick as she gazed
upon the suffering around her, her gentle heart
touched inexpressibly by the scenes and sounds, the
groans, and cries, and moans; and in some cases&mdash;more
touching than any other&mdash;there was quiet patience,
brave heroism; there were those&mdash;real heroes&mdash;who
set their teeth hard together over the groans
that would try to force themselves through, and bore
stoically the tortures of the lost.</p>

<p>The sun set upon that busy day, a day never to be
forgotten by Beatrix Dane, never while she lived.
The sun had set and twilight was coming down, and
all alone in the ward for hopeless cases, Beatrix bent
over the haggard face of an old woman&mdash;a coarse-featured,
hard-handed old creature&mdash;who while intoxicated,
had fallen under the wheels of a passing
cab, and had been carried to the Home, which chanced
to be nearer than the charity hospital. Beatrix was
bathing the woman's brow with Cologne water, speaking
gentle, kindly words of sympathy all the time,
when a voice spoke her name, a voice which always
had an influence over Beatrix, and which she had
learned to love dearly&mdash;Sister Angela's. Beatrix turned
as the sister laid her hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>"My dear," the kind voice went on, gently, "you
are overworked; you have done too much today for a
novice; you must rest now. Go down to the little
sitting-room and you will find some tea there. Yes,
I insist upon it. I will take your place here."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Beatrix's dark eyes rested lovingly upon the sister's
pale face.</p>

<p>"You are tired out already, sister; you were up all
night."</p>

<p>"But I am accustomed to that, my dear," Sister
Angela returned, firmly; "and I find that the very
best way to be of use in this place is to husband your
strength, and keep some always in reserve. Go now,
my child. You do not know what may lie before you
ere this night is done."</p>

<p>Were her words prophetic? Looking back upon
them afterward, Beatrix could almost believe them
so. She went slowly away, however, for she would
not disobey the kind sister; and as Beatrix went
slowly down-stairs, Sister Angela took her place by
the old woman's side. Not until she had reached the
foot of the stairs did the girl realize how very weak
she was.</p>

<p>"Sister Angela is right," she said to herself. "My
strength is not sufficient to keep up as she does. That
will come in time."</p>

<p>She went to the room where she had been directed,
and after she had drunk a cup of tea and partaken of
some refreshment she felt better. She was about to
return to her task, when there was a loud ring at the
door-bell, followed by a bustle and confusion in the
entrance hall.</p>

<p>"Another case, I suppose," commented the girl, and
she hastened into the hall just as one of the assistants
came hastily to meet her.</p>

<p>"An accident!" she announced briefly. "A man has
been thrown from his horse right in front of the door;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
so, of course, he was brought in here, and Heaven
knows we have scarcely room enough to receive any
more. The affair of yesterday has filled our wards
to overflowing."</p>

<p>They were bringing the injured man into the hall,
lying upon a stretcher, the pallid face uncovered, the
eyes closed, as though Death had already set his seal
there.</p>

<p>One glance, and Beatrix flew to the side of the
stretcher with a wild cry which re-echoed through
the house like a knell. But cries of pain and anguish
were of too common an occurrence there to excite
any comment.</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees beside the sofa where the
injured man had been placed, and wrung her hands
in frantic grief.</p>

<p>"Keith! Keith!" she wailed, in her wild, bitter
anguish. "It is Keith, my husband, and he is dead!"</p>

<p>That agonized cry seemed to bring Keith back to
life. The beautiful dark eyes flared swiftly open, and
rested upon the white, terrified face bending over his
own.</p>

<p>"Beatrix!"</p>

<p>The name faltered from his pale lips in one wild,
joyous outcry; then the eyelids fluttered down and
he was unconscious once more. Beatrix rose to her
feet, pale and still.</p>

<p>"Take him up to my own room," she said, turning
to the men who had borne that still form into the
house. "He will be my especial care.&mdash;He is my
husband!" Then she added, after a slight pause: "If
you will carry him up now, I will lead the way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>They obeyed her without a word, and Keith Kenyon
was carried to his wife's room, and placed in bed,
while the physicians took possession of him, and Beatrix
hastened away to tell Sister Angela.</p>

<p>The good sister was pleased and glad for Beatrix's
sake that this strange occurrence had taken place, and
Beatrix would have the privilege of nursing the man
she so dearly loved. But the kindly face grew pale as
death as she thought of the fresh complications that
must now ensue. Who could foresee the end?</p>

<p>Beatrix took up her position at Keith's bedside and
nursed him indefatigably. The days came and went,
and still Keith lay there upon his bed of pain.
Through Doctor Darrow, Beatrix was able to send
word to old Bernard Dane as to Keith's whereabouts
and condition, though Beatrix preferred that her own
name should be kept out of the matter, and the message
to Mr. Dane was sent, purporting to have come
from Dr. Darrow.</p>

<p>Beatrix could not deny herself the privilege of nursing
her husband, even though she knew that with his
returning health she must go from him again. They
must separate, and never hope to be anything to each
other. Surely it was the saddest&mdash;the very saddest&mdash;experience
on record. But the brave girl was strong
in her determination. Better far to never see him again
than to expose the life so dear to her to such a horrible
fate!</p>

<p>It was the very acme of self-denial and abnegation;
but any true woman would have done as Beatrix
did. For what woman who loves a man will deliberately
expose him to suffering of any description, mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
or bodily? And this was such a horrible thing,
that no wonder the poor girl, feeling herself accursed,
felt at times almost tempted to take her own life, so
that she might escape from the horrors of the future,
and above all, put it beyond the possibility of harming
the one so dearly loved.</p>

<p>One day, not long after Keith's arrival at the Home,
Beatrix was informed that a lady and gentleman
wished to see Mr. Kenyon. They were in the waiting-room,
and Beatrix hastened thither to receive them.</p>

<p>She had fully expected to meet old Bernard Dane,
and probably Mrs. Graves. The thought of Serena
had never once entered her mind; for as Keith was
almost always delirious, he could not tell her of the
strange changes that had taken place since Beatrix
had left home.</p>

<p>Imagine her surprise, as she entered the reception-room,
to see at the old man's side Serena, the woman
who so cordially hated her&mdash;Serena, her bitter, implacable
foe!</p>

<p>As Beatrix entered the room, old Bernard Dane
uttered a wild cry of delight.</p>

<p>"Beatrix! Good heavens! is it really you?" he faltered,
brokenly. "We&mdash;we thought that you were
dead!"</p>

<p>She smiled; but still she observed, with a pang at
her sensitive heart, that he did not come near her, or
even take her hand. Did he fear contagion?</p>

<p>Serena drew back as she came near, as though she
feared infection from the girl's presence.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Serena?" said Beatrix, quietly.
"I did not expect to see you; this is quite a surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
I thought that you had returned to your home in the
North long ago."</p>

<p>This is Serena's hour of triumph; for the sake of
this moment of supreme satisfaction, she would have
given a year of her life. She drew herself up proudly,
and the pale eyes shone like glass.</p>

<p>"I shall never return North to live!" her shrill, high-pitched
tones made answer; "my home is in New
Orleans now. Have you not heard? Do you never
see the newspapers? I am married. I am Mrs. Bernard
Dane!"</p>

<p>In an instant Beatrix's mind had grasped the situation.
She saw at once that this was Serena's game
of vengeance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">SERENA'S FAILURE.</p>


<p>As Serena's announcement was made, and the words
fell upon the silence with a clear note of triumph
pealing through her voice, Beatrix fell back faint and
stunned. She realized the truth at once; she saw
Serena's game, and knew that she had won. She saw
that Serena&mdash;stung by the fact that Keith Kenyon's
love would never be hers, and that he had allowed
himself to be led into an engagement which he had
not desired, and of which he soon grew weary, and
so had repudiated her&mdash;all this had made Serena a
very devil. And then added to it was the fact of her
own poverty. And here, right within her grasp, was
the chance to retrieve herself, to gain a grand home
and a fortune, and at the same time ruin Keith Kenyon
forever. For the young man had been reared to
believe himself to be Bernard Dane's prospective heir;
and, of course, with such a rearing he was utterly unfitted
for any position in life where he could earn his
own bread. Surely the future looming up before him
was pitiful to contemplate.</p>

<p>It was a revenge worthy of a woman&mdash;of a hard-hearted
woman&mdash;one who has the fires of baleful jealousy
burning in her heart.</p>

<p>It is said that a jealous woman is fit to reign in
hell, and it is easy to believe it. Serena was half insane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
with jealous wrath, and would hesitate at nothing
in the way of her scheme to punish Keith Kenyon
for not loving her. As though it were possible for
Keith to control and direct his own heart! For love
is not a matter of our own volition. It must go where
it is sent by fate; we can not steer its course. And
so Serena, with her mad determination to revolutionize
nature, must needs attempt to wreck two lives
already saddened by the darkest and most bitter of
sorrows&mdash;a sorrow more cruel than death.</p>

<p>All this had flashed through Beatrix's brain as she
stood there, her eyes upon Serena's pale, triumphant
face, her heart sinking slowly into the very depths
of dark despair. Keith's life was ruined&mdash;ruined irretrievably,
his fortune gone, and the heavy, clanking
chains of a marriage which could never be a real marriage,
after all, fettering his every movement. And
she was to blame for it all. In loving him and giving
herself to him she had signed Keith Kenyon's death-warrant&mdash;a
fearful, living death in life. She shuddered
convulsively and sank into a seat.</p>

<p>"I cannot congratulate you, Serena," she returned,
at last, forcing her white lips to speak, "because this
marriage of yours is unnatural and wrong. No marriage
will ever be sanctified without love&mdash;true love&mdash;and
you have wedded this old man for his money."</p>

<p>Serena started angrily, and the red blood suffused
her cheek for a moment.</p>

<p>"You had better choose your words in addressing
me!" she snarled. "I will not bear your insults. I
have come here to see Keith. Am I to see him or
not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can not!" returned the young wife, bravely.
"He is very ill, and I am his nurse. I would not permit
any one for whom he cared to come to his bedside;
I most certainly, then, will not admit you!"</p>

<p>Her voice rang out clear and determined. Serena's
face grew ghastly white, and her pale eyes scintillated.</p>

<p>"I will make you sorry for that!" she stormed.
"How came you here? Who constituted you Keith
Kenyon's nurse?"</p>

<p>"I have a right to nurse him; I, and I alone!" returned
Beatrix, calmly. "And, besides that, I am a
nurse&mdash;or, rather, an assistant here&mdash;and it would be
my duty to nurse him. This is my refuge, my home."</p>

<p>A scornful sneer curled Serena's thin lip.</p>

<p>"And do not the sick people here risk contagion
from such as you?" she cried.</p>

<p>It was a cruel question, but the hard heart of the
jealous woman was capable of any cruelty to this girl
who was her rival&mdash;who, no matter what Serena did,
or how she planned and schemed, somehow always
seemed to get ahead of her without an effort. Even
now, accursed as she was, with this hideous inheritance
hanging over her head like a two-edged sword, she
was more blessed than Serena, for was she not allowed
to nurse this man whom they both loved, while
Serena was shut out even from a sight of his face?</p>

<p>"I will see him!" she cried, angrily. "I will find
the matron of this institution, and demand to see
Keith Kenyon. I have as much right to him as you."</p>

<p>Beatrix's large dark eyes met the gaze of the angry
woman with a slow, calm scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is my husband," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>Serena's eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;what are you?" she demanded. "Accursed!
According to the law of the land he is not
your husband, because a creature like you is an accursed
thing, set aside and apart from other human
beings, something too dreadful to contemplate. You
must be mad to think that your marriage to Keith
Kenyon is, or can be, lawful. Any court in the land
will give him freedom from such as you."</p>

<p>Beatrix could not speak; she could not utter a word;
she could only sit staring blankly before her, hearing
Serena's terrible words, yet not heeding them apparently.
But all the same every word, every syllable,
sank into her heart like a branding iron, and stayed
there. Perhaps it was true. Doubtless the courts of
law would give Keith his freedom, if there was any
law to fit this special and unusual case.</p>

<p>She would try. For his sake she would give him
back his freedom. All this flashed through her brain
as she sat there under Serena's scathing words, saying
nothing, but hearing all. Old Bernard Dane intervened
at length.</p>

<p>"Serena," he said, in his dictatorial way, "this is
quite enough; you have no right to annoy and trouble
poor Beatrix in this fashion. My child," turning to
Beatrix with a deprecating air, "tell me, do you discover
any symptoms of&mdash;of that awful trouble? How
is your health, my dear?"</p>

<p>Beatrix's eyes&mdash;full of mournful protest&mdash;met his
gaze.</p>

<p>"I am very well," she returned, gently; "never was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
better in my life. And I find no trace of anything
that could ever so remotely resemble that awful thing
to which you refer. It may be in my system, but so
far I see nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>She choked down the emotion which overpowered
her, and turned aside.</p>

<p>"Never mind, child. Don't trouble yourself to explain
to me," cried the old man, hastily. "I did not
mean to hurt your feelings. I only wanted to know.
Now, Serena, if you are satisfied, I think we had better
take our departure. Then we can not see Keith?"</p>

<p>Beatrix shook her head.</p>

<p>"He will recover, I feel sure," she returned; "but
his recovery rests entirely upon his being kept quiet.
Doctor Darrow says that it will take time. Several
of his ribs are broken, and he has sustained other injuries.
I will let you know every day how he is, Uncle
Bernard."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear; thank you!" he cried, as he
rose to go.</p>

<p>Serena said nothing, but her plain face wore a look
that was not good to see. She only bowed coldly to
Beatrix, and followed her liege lord from the room.
A little later the sound of wheels going down the
street told Beatrix that they were gone. She bowed
her head upon her hands and gave vent to a storm of
tears which she had been bravely choking back.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me to bear my burden," she murmured,
softly. "Heaven give me strength."</p>

<p>In the meantime the Dane carriage drove homeward.
Once arrived there, Bernard Dane went straight
to the library. He opened the door, then started back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with an exclamation of surprise. The room was occupied.
A slight figure, all in black, sat at the escritoire,
with bowed head resting upon one hand. He drew
near and laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Celia!" he exclaimed. "Celia Ray, what brings
you here?"</p>

<p>She lifted her head, and her ghastly face&mdash;ghastly
from mental suffering&mdash;met his gaze. She rose slowly
to her feet and faced him, like a forgotten sin come
back from its grave to reproach him; and so she was.</p>

<p>"Bernard!"&mdash;her voice was low and tremulous&mdash;"I
have only just heard of your marriage&mdash;your mad, insane
marriage to Serena, my niece&mdash;my niece, remember&mdash;and
so I came to see you at once. Now, answer
me one question. What did you mean by promising
me never to marry? You refused to make me your
wife&mdash;to atone for the wrong you had done me, but
you did promise not to marry any one else. You have
broken your word, as all men do. False! false! false!
Now, listen to me, Bernard Dane."</p>

<p>She drew herself up to an erect position, and her
eyes glared into his face with a look of utter hatred,
and the worst hatred in the world is that which is born
of a slighted love. Her voice sounded like the hissing
of a serpent as she went on:</p>

<p>"I can tell you something which would alter all your
life, and make you happy, but I refuse to do it. I
intend to punish you for what you have done. Go
on in your fool's life, Bernard Dane; the day is coming
when you will remember me, and curse the hour
in which you first deceived me!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A THREAT.</p>


<p>The old man's face grew pale and troubled.</p>

<p>"Celia, can not you let by-gones be by-gones?" he
cried, tremulously. "I am old and feeble. I needed
some one to take care of me, and as Serena&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Offered herself? Yes, I suppose that is about the
case. All the same, I should think that you would
have kept the promise you made me, since that was
all the atonement you could make for my lost life&mdash;my
ruined happiness. Bernard Dane, you are a villain!"</p>

<p>The old man's face grew stern, and a grim smile
touched his lips.</p>

<p>"So I am. I don't deny it, Celia. When I look
back upon my own past and recall all my awful deeds,
and worse than all else, the plot that I had formed
against two lives&mdash;the cruel, horrible plot&mdash;to ruin the
happiness of two innocent hearts, I hate myself, I
scorn myself, I loathe myself. Celia, you can not
speak one half as bad of me as I deserve. But do not
arraign me for taking the step that I have taken. I
was ill and alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might have sent for me!" the woman cried,
passionately. "I would have nursed and tended you.
But instead you hung a mill-stone around your neck
which will prove your ruin. Serena Lynne is an artful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
designing wretch, yet you think she is disinterested,
perhaps. Bernard Dane, I am your wife in
all justice&mdash;ay, more&mdash;"</p>

<p>She checked herself abruptly. The old man bowed
his head, and silence&mdash;awful silence&mdash;fell over the
room. Every word that she had uttered had stung his
heart with the full force of truth, and for a time conscience&mdash;that
whip of scorpions&mdash;stung him with its
bitter smart.</p>

<p>Well, it was some satisfaction to be convinced that
he still possessed a conscience. He drew a little
nearer her side at length, and laid his hand upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Celia,"&mdash;quite humbly he spoke her name&mdash;"won't
you try to be less hard with me? I do not deserve it
from you. And yet," he added, swiftly, at sight of
the expression which crossed her face, "I acknowledge
that I have wronged you, and&mdash;and I had no right to
break my promise; but it is too late now. I could not
atone under any circumstances now for past mistakes.
You ought not to come here to make trouble, Celia."</p>

<p>"No,"&mdash;her eyes flashed angrily&mdash;"I ought not to
make trouble for you. Of course not. You ought
to have all the easy places in life, while I toil along
over the rough, stony road. You are like all other
men&mdash;false, and selfish, and cruel&mdash;hard as iron. All
the same, I will keep my secret&mdash;the secret which I
have long considered the advisability of telling you,
but which I now think wiser to bury in my own breast.
It is a secret which would make your life a happier
one, and brighten up the skies immensely for other
parties. But it will keep. I will do no good&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
kindness&mdash;to you who have made my life so utterly
miserable&mdash;a wretched failure. I will return evil for
evil!"</p>

<p>Her voice rang out harsh and hard; her white face
was set and stern; she grasped the arm of the chair
in which she was sitting as though to gain strength.
Low under her breath she muttered, softly:</p>

<p>"If he only knew, if he only knew! Dare I tell
him? He looks so old and worn, the shock might
kill him."</p>

<p>She arose and walked over to the window, and
stood there gazing forth upon the grounds without,
her pale face full of grave trouble. That there was
something upon her mind, something that troubled
her and made her very anxious, there could be no
doubt. She turned away from the window and began
to pace slowly up and down the long room, her
hands clasped, her eyes full of brooding care.</p>

<p>"I will go," she said to herself, at last, decisively.
"If I remain here any longer, I shall be tempted to
make a clean breast of the whole affair."</p>

<p>She turned abruptly about.</p>

<p>"I am going, Mr. Dane," she said, coldly; "good-bye."</p>

<p>He bowed his head, but made no attempt to speak.
She turned away. The door opened and closed behind
her. Celia Ray was gone.</p>

<p>Out in the hall she came face to face with Serena.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Dane!"&mdash;with a curious intonation in
her voice, her steely eyes fixed upon Serena's startled
face&mdash;"I must congratulate you&mdash;ahem! I suppose
now you consider that you have made quite a grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
match for yourself, that you have wedded a wealthy
old man, whose entire fortune will go to you some
day in the near future? My dear Serena, 'there's
many a slip 'twixt cup and lip'."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Serena, harshly.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;of course not. Only some day your
eyes will see the truth, and you will be astonished,
Mrs. Dane!"</p>

<p>A swift, angry light leaped into Serena's eyes. She
turned away with a wrathful gesture just as Simons
appeared.</p>

<p>"Simons,"&mdash;Mrs. Dane's voice was cold and hard&mdash;"show
this woman out, and if she ever ventures here
again do not admit her."</p>

<p>Simons bowed.</p>

<p>"I'll do so, ma'am, suah!" he returned.</p>

<p>"Will you?" retorted Mrs. Ray. "Very well. Mrs.
Serena, your day is done. This insult is the last straw
that breaks the camel's back. I will pay you off for
this, if I swing for it!"</p>

<p>She walked swiftly to the outer door, and waving
Simons aside, opened it herself and passed out. Her
face was white as death, her eyes burning like flame.</p>

<p>"I will hesitate no longer!" she muttered low under
her breath as she plunged on down the street. "Serena
shall suffer for this! I will not hesitate for the sake
of shielding him! I will do the work of destruction!
I will tumble down Serena's little house of cards! If
they had treated me differently&mdash;if Bernard had been
kinder, and that wretch Serena not so insulting&mdash;I
might have spared them, I might have continued to
keep my secret. I have kept it for years; it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
have gone to the grave with me. But the time has
come at last, and I will tell, if I die for it!"</p>

<p>The words faltered into silence upon her lips. She
had been walking rapidly down the street, and as she
spoke she was crossing to an opposite corner. Just at
that moment down the long avenue a carriage came
tearing, drawn by a pair of frightened horses running
away. On, on they came! There was the sound of a
fall, a wild, agonized cry of human suffering, and
Celia Ray lay upon the stone pavement, with the iron-shod
hoofs of the horses trampling her down.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A NOBLE LOVE.</p>


<p>A crowd gathered in a moment to the scene of the
disaster. Poor Celia's bruised and bleeding body was
lifted from the ground and borne into a neighboring
drug store. Here she was placed upon a sofa, and
everything was done to resuscitate her that skill could
suggest. Doctor Darrow chanced to be passing&mdash;or
was it chance? In the days that came afterward,
Douglas Darrow was wont to look back upon that
moment, and humbly thank God for having directed
his footsteps to the place where Celia Ray had been
carried. For that occurrence was the beginning of a
new chapter in the strange romance, a turning-point
which was destined to bring about the end as unexpected
as strange.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was a stranger to the young physician,
and all inquiry failed to elicit any information as to
her identity. In all the great city she could not have
fallen into better hands than those of Doctor Darrow,
for he was the kindest-hearted and most philanthropic
of men. At last, despairing of ever reaching the truth
in regard to the woman, Doctor Darrow sent her to
the Home for treatment. He might have sent her to
the Charity Hospital, but there was something in the
forlorn aspect of the woman&mdash;something pathetic, it
seemed to him&mdash;and there was a familiar look about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
her face which perplexed the doctor, for he was certain
that he had never met the woman before. Yet
the intangible resemblance to some one whom he had
met before lingered in his mind, and he could not
shut it out. So, with a vague feeling that it was his
duty to do so, he ordered the unfortunate woman
to be taken to the Home, where her injuries were
promptly attended to. She was in a very precarious
condition; Doctor Darrow saw that, and he entertained
grave fears for her recovery. And, even in the event
of her recovery, there were serious fears entertained
from the effects of the blow upon her head from the
horse's feet, which might result in insanity. It
transpired that when Beatrix was not with Keith, she
found plenty of occupation in the ward where Celia
Ray was confined to her bed. As soon as Beatrix
saw her she recognized the likeness to Mrs. Lynne,
save that this woman's face was more refined, and
bore the traces of sorrow and suffering.</p>

<p>"I wonder who she is?" the girl asked herself, as
she stood gazing down upon the white face of the
sufferer. "Surely I have seen her somewhere before.
She looks just like Mrs. Lynne, only there is a difference."</p>

<p>Even as the words passed her lips, the woman
turned uneasily upon the pillow, murmuring as she
did so:</p>

<p>"Bernard! Bernard! You will not be so cruel&mdash;so
cruel!"</p>

<p>Beatrix started at the sound of that familiar name.
But the sufferer had wandered away again into wild
and incoherent delirium, and Beatrix could gain no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
information from the words which passed her lips.
But still some strange influence drew her as often as
possible to the ward where Celia Ray lay, growing
gradually worse and weaker, until it became evident
that she had not long to live. But there was something
upon her mind. She tossed and turned in the
fever and delirium, moaning and muttering broken
fragments of a strange story, over and over, but so
brokenly and fragmentary that Beatrix and Doctor
Darrow could make nothing of her raving.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Keith was recovering slowly but
surely. And now the hour had come when Beatrix
knew that she must have a talk with him, and go
through the anguish of parting once more. Doctor
Darrow had listened to Beatrix's announcement that
the injured man was her husband, and his noble heart,
though crushed with its sorrow and loneliness, did not
shrink from the task before him. He had devoted
himself to Keith Kenyon as much as he possibly could,
and to the earnest labors of the young physician, as
well as Beatrix's tender care, Keith Kenyon owed his
return to health. The time came when Beatrix, standing
at his bedside, listened to Keith's pleading words&mdash;words
which broke her heart afresh.</p>

<p>"You shall not leave me, my darling!" the young
man cried, passionately. "My wife, my wife, I need
you! You must not separate us in this dreadful way,
this death in life. It is worse than though death itself
had intervened to tear us apart. Beatrix, look
up, my beautiful darling, and say that you will give
up this mad separation. It has not been proven that
you are really&mdash;that you&mdash;that the disease is even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
your system. Such things have been heard of before.
For two or three generations a curse like that may
lie dormant and then suddenly appear, just when it
had come to be believed that it had been eradicated.
It may never show itself in your life-time, my darling,
and in any case you are my wife, and I claim you.
Come, Beatrix!"</p>

<p>"I can not, I must not! Keith, Keith, don't you
know that you are holding open the very gates of
Heaven to me, and yet I can not, dare not, enter?
Don't you know that I would rather lay down my
life today than be the cause of possible danger to
you? Oh, my husband, so dear to me, don't tempt
me, don't tempt me, or you will break my heart anew.
For I can not, dare not, consent."</p>

<p>He bowed his head upon his hands and a storm of
sobs shook his frame, sobs which choked his voice
and made speech impossible. Beatrix laid her hand
upon his head. It was to her the very bitterest of
anguish to stand at his side and not dare to let her
lips meet his in a sweet, clinging kiss of love; and
she had not ventured to kiss his lips since that awful
shock had come crashing down upon her like an avalanche&mdash;the
discovery of the awful shadow upon her
life, her dark inheritance.</p>

<p>She turned away pale and trembling. After a time
she crept back to him and laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Keith, my own, my precious husband!" she whispered,
"this is more bitter to us than death&mdash;this parting&mdash;but
it must be. And so, since we know that
there is no hope for us&mdash;that we must be parted anyway&mdash;would
it not be better for you, for your future&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
have none, you know&mdash;to place the matter in the
hands of the law, to appeal to the courts for your
freedom? I am certain the fact of my being what
I am, will be sufficient to free you. Oh, Keith,
Keith! I can not be a blight upon you forever! You
must be free from me, and hold up your head once
more among your fellowmen. And once free, you will
some time in the future, dearest, meet some one
else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! For God's sake, stop! How can you speak
such words to me?" he groaned, desperately. "Beatrix,
you are my wife; whether we live as husband
and wife, or are forever separated here upon earth,
does not matter. You are mine and I am yours; no
one can alter that. And whether we live apart or
anear, I shall always be your husband&mdash;yours alone&mdash;until
death shall part us. You remember the solemn
marriage service, Beatrix, and the vows we took before
God's holy altar? Never mention the divorce
court to me again, my beautiful love&mdash;it is sacrilege&mdash;that
can never be. Now, Beatrix, try to cheer up
and hope for the best. Your case may not be hopeless,
you know, and anyway&mdash;no matter what happens&mdash;even
though the very worst, remember that I love
you and you alone, and I shall love you till I die. Ah,
there comes Doctor Darrow! I believe that I will
tell him all our sad story, my Beatrix, and ask his
advice and opinion. He has been so very kind to me;
and to his skill, as much as your splendid nursing, I
owe my restoration to health. For I shall soon be
well now; I am sure of it. I am getting stronger and
better every day. Ah, Doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Keith paused as the young physician drew near, his
face quite pale and grave, in his eyes a look of something
like suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kenyon," he said, turning to Beatrix with a
look in his sad, gray eyes which touched her heart in
spite of herself, "will you go to Mrs. Ray? She is
asking for you, and I think that there is something
upon her mind which will not be relieved until she
has seen you."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A DEATH BED.</p>


<p>Beatrix rose from her seat at her husband's side
and left the room in obedience to Doctor Darrow.
Entering the ward where Mrs. Ray was lying, she
went to the bedside and seated herself in a chair that
stood near. The sick woman's eyes were wide open
and fixed upon her face with an eager look of inquiry,
as though longing to ask a question which,
after all, she feared to put into words. Beatrix bent
over the woman's pillow, and her eyes rested kindly
upon the white, pain-distorted face.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me, Doctor Darrow says," Beatrix
began at once.</p>

<p>A look of eager interest flashed over the sunken
features, and one cold hand grasped the girl's arm
in a vise-like grip. Her eyes glowed with a wild,
supernatural light, her breath came and went in feeble,
fitful gasps pitiful to witness.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes; I want to see you. I always want to
see you," she panted, brokenly. "Come&mdash;come here.
There, child, kneel down beside me where I can see
your dear face; and&mdash;and take me in your arms, Beatrix,
won't you? You will surely not refuse my last
request?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. If I can ease your pain in any way,
or do anything for you, I will be so glad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Beatrix had fallen upon her knees, and pillowed the
poor head upon her breast. Something&mdash;a strange,
unaccountable feeling of something like affection crept
into the girl's heart as the worn cheek came in contact
with her own.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, softly; "tell me."</p>

<p>Celia Ray's eyes studied the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"It seems strange," she said, softly, after a long
survey of every feature, "that you should be so beautiful.
Your father is&mdash;was, I mean&mdash;anything but
handsome; and your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mother was a beautiful woman," interrupted
Beatrix, hastily. "I have seen her portrait. She was
far too lovely to have been my mother."</p>

<p>A strange expression crept over Celia Ray's worn
face. She opened her lips as though to speak, but no
words passed them.</p>

<p>"Beatrix," she said, softly, after a slight pause, "I
have sent for you to ask you to do me a favor. I&mdash;I
have something serious&mdash;of the greatest importance&mdash;to
say, a confession to make. Will you see that I
have a notary and necessary witnesses? This that I
wish to say is most important; it must be placed upon
paper."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;Beatrix strove to be cheerful&mdash;"you will
get well, Mrs. Ray. Doctor Darrow says that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doctor Darrow has acknowledged to me that my
chances are small," interrupted Celia, hastily. "And,
in any case, I must make this confession. It should
have been made long ago, to try and set right a deadly
wrong. Beatrix,"&mdash;wistfully&mdash;"you do not despise or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
dislike me, do you? You have nothing against me,
have you, dear?"</p>

<p>Beatrix looked the surprise which she could not
speak.</p>

<p>"I? Good heavens, no! I scarcely know you."</p>

<p>A look of disappointment and pain, which was not
all physical, crept over the white, sunken face.</p>

<p>"Small wonder!" she muttered, under her breath;
"and whose fault is it, after all?" Then, aloud, she
added, eagerly, "I&mdash;I wanted to talk to you about this;
that was the reason why I did not send for Doctor
Darrow. He is good, but, then, he is nothing to me,
after all. I am, of course, only one of his patients
to him; he feels no personal interest in me or my fate.
Beatrix, you will care, you will have some affection
for me? Don't look so surprised. I&mdash;I knew your
mother. I saw you when you were a babe. Many a
time I have held you in my arms, for I was your nurse,
you know. I was selected to rear you, and also Keith&mdash;dear
Keith! And now you are his wife? Well,
that is as it should be. You did not know that I had
nursed you," she went on swiftly, smiling feebly at
the look of astonishment upon Beatrix's face; "but
Bernard Dane knew, and he will tell you that I am
speaking truly. You will send a notary to me, will
you not?" she cried, her voice rising shrill and troubled.</p>

<p>Beatrix rose.</p>

<p>"You shall have whatever you wish," she returned.
"I will go at once and attend to it."</p>

<p>"Beatrix."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you kiss me?"</p>

<p>No answer; Beatrix turned away. Even though this
woman was dying, the girl shrank in her own sensitive
way from pressing her lips to those which contagion
was powerless now to injure.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;can not," she responded. "Mrs. Ray, you do
not know&mdash;I&mdash;am forbidden to kiss any living creature,
even my own."</p>

<p>A strange light flared into the sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!" she muttered; "for I alone am
responsible for all this."</p>

<p>But before Beatrix could speak an awful spasm of
pain seized the woman, and for a few moments it
seemed as though the life would leave the frail, pain-racked
frame. But after a time the paroxysm passed,
and very still and pale, Celia Ray lay back upon the
pillow, her eyes closed, her breath coming and going
in panting gasps. She opened her eyes at last and
fixed them upon Beatrix's face with an eager look, a
devouring expression that made the girl's heart throb
with a strange sensation which she had never before
experienced.</p>

<p>"I have never before felt so strange an influence,"
Beatrix said to herself, as she met the look of hungry
affection from the sunken eyes.</p>

<p>Celia lifted one feeble hand with a gesture toward
the door. Beatrix understood.</p>

<p>"I am going now for the notary," she responded at
once. "Do you think that you are strong enough to
attend&mdash;to&mdash;see him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I must be, I will be. It is a matter of
vital importance, life or death. Go at once, my child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a strange note of wistful tenderness in
the poor, feeble voice&mdash;something which touched an
answering chord in Beatrix's breast and made her feel
strangely sad. She left the room at once, and finding
Doctor Darrow, told him of Mrs. Ray's wish to see
a notary. The physician looked grave.</p>

<p>"That there is something of great and serious importance
upon her mind, I have no doubt," he said,
"for I have watched her closely. I believe, from the
bottom of my heart, that it is that which retards her
recovery. Yet, after all, her recovery is very uncertain;
I fear it is out of the question for her, poor
soul! I will send a notary and two witnesses," he
added, hastening away.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a grave, elderly man entered the
ward where Celia Ray lay still and weak, waiting for
him to come.</p>

<p>Writing materials were soon brought, and the work
began. In a low but perfectly distinct voice, Celia
Ray repeated the statement which she wished the notary
to transcribe. It took some time, and it was late
in the evening before it was concluded, and the paper
signed, witnessed, and properly sealed. Then the notary
arose to go. The sick woman sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"Give me the document!" she cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>It was placed in her hand.</p>

<p>"Now send for Beatrix!" she demanded, in a loud,
shrill tone. "And in the morning&mdash;the first thing in
the morning&mdash;I must see Bernard Dane. I will not
have him disturbed tonight, for he is old and does not
sleep well. I will wait until morning."</p>

<p>Even in dying, the poor creature studied, first of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the comfort of this man so dearly loved, and who had
wrecked her life. But alas! when morning came, poor
Celia was gone, and Bernard Dane would never look
into her eyes or hear her voice again. She passed
away quietly about midnight. The trained nurse sat
at her bedside.</p>

<p>"I want Beatrix!" she cried, lifting her head from
the pillow. "Send her to me; I need her. It is so dark&mdash;so
dark and cold! I will hold her hand, and then I
shall not be so lonely."</p>

<p>So Beatrix was summoned from her bed, where she
had gone, for Doctor Darrow had insisted upon her
taking a good night's rest, as it did not seem likely that
she would be needed that night.</p>

<p>She came to the bedside of the dying woman. As
soon as her eyes fell on the gray, pinched face, Beatrix
knew that Celia Ray's journey here was nearly done.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Celia opened her feeble arms.</p>

<p>"Come to me, my baby!" she cried. "Come to the
one who has loved you so! Beatrix the clouds are lifting
from your life; you will soon be very happy. Tell
me, do you hate Serena?"</p>

<p>Beatrix shuddered.</p>

<p>"No; I hate no one," she returned gravely. "It is
very wrong to do so. Let us hope that Serena will be
sorry for what she has done."</p>

<p>"She will never be sorry&mdash;never, until she dies!"
panted the dying woman, wildly. "I know her; she is
a wicked, cruel woman. She has tried to break your
heart, my darling; for she hated you for your beauty,
and because Keith Kenyon loved you. She is hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
heartless, cruel and vindictive&mdash;a wicked woman&mdash;and
she deserves her downfall. Beatrix, here is the paper
that the notary executed to-night, also some other papers
of great importance. I leave all with you. You
will open them one month after I am dead. By that
time, so Doctor Darrow says, Keith will be fully
restored to his former strength and health, and I&mdash;shall
be forgotten in my lonely grave."</p>

<p>"No, no!" sobbed Beatrix, a strange, desolate feeling
touching her tender heart with a pang of suffering,
a curious sensation that in some way this woman's
life, sad, lonely, ever reaching out for something,
one thing unattainable, was in some way connected
with her own, "you shall not be forgotten. I will do
all that I can."</p>

<p>"I understand. Then my baby will go to see the
lonely grave sometimes where poor Celia sleeps&mdash;even
the name upon the stone a false one. Listen, child; I
am not poor, and what I have is all for you."</p>

<p>"But your sister, Mrs. Lynne&mdash;" began Beatrix, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"She has never been a sister to me," panted the dying
woman, wildly; "and I have carefully concealed
from her the secret of my life, because she was not fit
to share it. But no matter now; the papers will tell
you all. Now I am tired and must sleep. Kiss me,
Beatrix; I am dying, and I am&mdash;your&mdash;"</p>

<p>She strove hard with a mighty struggle to speak another
word, but the rigid lips refused to give it utterance.
The word which was not spoken in life could
never be spoken in death. Beatrix stooped and kissed
her. She smiled sweetly and so, smiling, died.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN DEADLY PERIL.</p>


<p>Beatrix felt a strange sensation as she stood alone
at the midnight hour beside the dead woman. It was
not terror, it was not the natural and instinctive shrinking
from death&mdash;death in any form; for Beatrix had
seen so much of the dread messenger that she had
grown inured to such scenes since she had come to
live at the Home. But still within the girl's heart there
lingered a strange feeling of sorrow, as though she had
lost a friend, a very dear friend.</p>

<p>She drew the sheet up over the calm, white face
upon the pillow; but first she kissed the cold cheek once
more. Then she took the package of papers and went
swiftly up to her own room. The nurse who had been
in charge had already hastened to give due notice of
Celia's death, and the poor body was soon prepared for
its last resting-place.</p>

<p>Beatrix locked the precious papers safely away in
her own wardrobe, then she threw herself upon her bed
to try and get a little sleep. She was very tired, and
her eyes closed at once, and she was soon in the land of
dreams&mdash;strange land, whither we all stray at times,
sometimes with friends, and often with those whose
faces we do not know, and whom we meet only in the
land of dreams. Beatrix dreamed that night of Celia
Ray. It seemed that the dead woman came to her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
took her in her arms, and held her close to her heart,
whispering tender, loving words, and calling her her
baby and darling child. Beatrix awoke with a feeling
that she had been with spirits, for the presence of the
dead woman in her slumbers had seemed so real.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Beatrix dispatched a messenger
to Bernard Dane with the information of Celia's
death. To her surprise, the old man himself made his
appearance at the Home and he came alone. He inquired
for Beatrix, and when she entered the reception
room she found him sitting with bowed gray head,
looking the very picture of despair.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he asked abruptly. "Beatrix, I
will send a burial casket, and I will have her body
brought to my house; the funeral services will be held
there."</p>

<p>He would vouchsafe no explanation for his great interest
in the dead woman, and Beatrix concluded it
was for the sake of old acquaintance that he intended
giving Celia Ray the grand, pompous funeral; and then
was she not Serena's aunt? Surely there was nothing
very strange in it, after all.</p>

<p>So everything was done as the old man directed.
The funeral took place from the old Dane mansion,
and Celia Ray's broken heart was laid to rest in the
Howard Cemetery beneath a green mound with white
marble coping&mdash;a lovely spot.</p>

<p>Serena looked like a galvanized corpse during the
funeral services, her pale eyes full of a half-angry
light. She hated the dead woman, and began to believe
that she had good reason to do so, for Bernard Dane
was mourning as one without hope over the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Celia Ray. Strange and unaccountable though it may
seem, no sooner was she dead and gone than Bernard
Dane began to appreciate her great and unselfish
affection for his unworthy self.</p>

<p>And Serena was aware of his grief. She watched
the old man as he moved about, the very image of woe,
his wrinkled face pale and worn, his form trembling,
and during the next four days he grew to look five
years older.</p>

<p>When the funeral was over and Mr. and Mrs. Dane
had returned to their great, solitary house, Serena
marched straight into the library, where her husband
sat, his head&mdash;grayer than ever now&mdash;resting upon his
hand, his eyes full of sadness.</p>

<p>"Now Mr. Dane," she began at once, in her shrill,
sharp voice, "I want to know what this means. I have
waited patiently for an explanation, but I will wait no
longer. I mean to get at the root of this mystery.</p>

<p>"What was Celia Ray to you? You can not deceive
me. I know perfectly well that no man would mourn
over a woman's death as you are mourning over hers,
unless there had been something very serious between
them. Tell me, for I will know!"</p>

<p>"She was the only woman that ever really loved me!"
groaned the old man, desperately. "And I loved another,
and turned from her. But she repaid me by a
life-time of devotion, and even when she died would
not send for me&mdash;so Beatrix tells me&mdash;because she
would not have me disturbed in the night. I have
never appreciated her worth before&mdash;never! I feel
that I have acted the part of a fiend to the best and
truest of women. You need not look so angry, Serena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I am only telling you the truth, which you demanded.
I shall mourn for Celia as long as I live, which, I trust
will not be much longer. I wronged her cruelly, and
I fear that God will never forgive me."</p>

<p>Surely old Bernard Dane was a changed man. A
few months before, such words would not have passed
his lips. Old age and the sorrows of his life were
crowding fast upon him now, and making him see the
folly of his past, and the blessings showered upon him
which he surely had not deserved. But Serena felt,
in her bitter hatred, that she could reach out and hurt
the poor woman in her grave.</p>

<p>"No matter," she cried angrily, as she sat nursing
her wrath to keep it warm; "I am mistress here and
Bernard Dane is old and feeble. It will not take long,
now that Aunt Celia is dead and out of the way, to resume
my old power over him. I must hold a tight
rein, or my control will be diminished. No more of
those people shall be allowed here. Beatrix must never
show her face here again. She shall never enter these
gates while I live!"</p>

<p>That night Beatrix retired earlier than usual. She
had attended Celia's funeral and seen her laid to rest;
then she had returned to Keith's side for a long and
loving conversation. She had not been assigned any
special task that night, and so it came to pass that she
was able to retire early, and was soon in a sound sleep.</p>

<p>She was aroused from sleep by a strange sensation&mdash;a
fear of approaching danger&mdash;a curious tightening
about the muscles of the throat, as though breath was
about to leave her. She sat up in bed and peered
through the darkness, uttering a low cry of horror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
as she did so. The room was filled with dense smoke.
The house was on fire!</p>

<p>With a sickening horror creeping slowly over her,
the girl rose and hurriedly dressed herself. Then remembering
the papers which Celia's dying hand had intrusted
to her care, she removed the package from the
wardrobe and hid it away in her bosom. She opened
the door of her room. Smoke&mdash;fire! Great, fiery
tongues of flame met her on every side. Choking,
gasping for breath, she turned in the direction of
Keith's chamber, which was situated at the furthest
end of the hall from her own. Could she save him?
His strength had not altogether returned to him.
Would he be able to make his escape, even with her
help?</p>

<p>"Then I will perish with him!" she murmured, desperately.
"Heaven help me! Heavenly Father, have
mercy, and direct me!"</p>

<p>Shouting wildly with all her strength the one word
"Fire!" she fought her way through the smoke and
flame down the long hall, and paused at last before the
door of Keith's chamber.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A MARTYR.</p>


<p>"Fire! fire! fire!"</p>

<p>The ominous cry rang forth through the silence of
the night, and instantly there was a response. Close
to Beatrix's side a slight form glided swiftly through
the thick black smoke, with red-hot tongues of flame
licking hungrily at her as she passed. A hand caught
Beatrix's arm, and a voice cried wildly:</p>

<p>"Child! child! where are you going?"</p>

<p>Beatrix turned to meet the frightened eyes of Sister
Angela.</p>

<p>"I am going to Keith&mdash;to my husband," she answered,
trying to calm her voice so that the sister could
hear her above the roar of the flames. "Ah, there is
Doctor Darrow! Doctor, save those poor people below,
if possible!" she went on wildly.</p>

<p>"My work is here!"</p>

<p>Douglas Darrow came to her side, and taking her
hand, raised it to his lips. There was a strange expression
upon his face, and his lips moved slowly, as
though he were speaking in a whisper; but the words
reached her ears.</p>

<p>"God bless and help you!" he said, hastily; and
then he moved rapidly away, and Beatrix threw open
the door of her husband's chamber.</p>

<p>Over the threshold she darted to the bedside, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
stooping, she shook the sleeping man with all her
strength.</p>

<p>"Keith! Keith!" she cried, wildly. "Wake up, my
darling! The house is on fire, and I have come to save
you!"</p>

<p>His dark eyes flew open with a dazed expression.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," he faltered.</p>

<p>"Come, Keith, come!" She lifted him in her arms
and drew him up to a sitting position. "See!" she
cried; "the flames are approaching us, and we shall
be cut off from all hope of safety. Come, my darling!"</p>

<p>He arose and dressed himself in a moment. The
fire was making fearful headway. How it had originated
no one could say; but it had the whole building
in its awful clutches, and it was evident that it must
be consumed.</p>

<p>Below stairs, Doctor Darrow worked like a hero,
doing all within his power to save the lives of the unfortunate
sick people.</p>

<p>At last, after an hour's hard labor, aided by the
gallant firemen and the assistants belonging to the
Home, all the sick were safely removed to a neighboring
house which happened to be vacant, and whose
doors were burst open for the purpose by Doctor Darrow.</p>

<p>In the midst of the bustle and confusion, the din
and uproar, the shrieks of the terrified patients, the
shouts of the firemen, and cheers from the crowd
gathered outside, assisting with all the ardor of a New
Orleans crowd, warm-hearted and sympathetic, ready
to do anything for their suffering fellow-creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Doctor Darrow forgot even Beatrix, and knew not
what had taken place.</p>

<p>Sister Angela, too, was fully occupied. She flitted
through the smoke-filled rooms like an angel of light,
helping, cheering&mdash;a very angel, indeed. The good
spirits were ever with her; the sweet, pale face looked
like the face of a saint.</p>

<p>One by one, she brought down and out into safety
the children connected with the institution, for there
was a large ward set apart for little ones; and of all
the sufferers, old and young, not one perished from
that night's awful work. None were called from this
life to the life to come but one who was well prepared&mdash;even
Sister Angela.</p>

<p>When the children were all carried forth, as was
believed, it occurred to her that there was one still
left within the burning building&mdash;a poor, puny little
creature who had been removed from the children's
ward to Sister Angela's own room&mdash;a tiny little closet
at the very top of the house. In the excitement of that
awful night, Sister Angela had rushed to the rescue of
the little ones, and had quite forgotten the sickly little
babe sleeping soundly in its cradle away up in the attic.</p>

<p>When all the children had been removed and the
little creatures marshaled together in the big empty
house opposite, one alone was found to be missing&mdash;the
little one placed under the care of Sister Angela.</p>

<p>"The baby!" she cried, aghast. "Oh, what shall I
do? It is up in my room!"</p>

<p>"My dear," returned the elderly sister who shared
Sister Angela's labors, "I fear that it is too late, that
nothing can be done. See, the whole house is wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in flames. I am sorry, Heaven knows, but I fear that
we can do nothing."</p>

<p>"I must&mdash;I must at least try!" Sister Angela was
wringing her hands frantically. "Oh, sister, I could
not live and know that&mdash;that the child was intrusted
to my care. God forbid that I should be the cause
of a little child&mdash;one of Christ's little ones&mdash;losing its
life!"</p>

<p>It seemed fanatical, for the babe was a sickly little
creature, and could not live long at best; but the face
of Sister Angela&mdash;white as marble&mdash;was set with a
resolute look. It was evident that she would not be
persuaded from her purpose.</p>

<p>"I must go!" she cried, wildly; "I dare not stay
behind. Let me go, sister, and if&mdash;if I never come
back, remember that I died in doing my duty!"</p>

<p>"May God and the saints have you in their holy
keeping!" said the sister, solemnly. And the martyr
disappeared within the flame-wrapped building. For
a moment the sister gazed after the vanishing figure,
then, white and horror-stricken, she started to follow
her.</p>

<p>"I can not stand here quietly and see her go to
certain death," she cried&mdash;"I can not do it."</p>

<p>But as she entered the burning house the black
smoke engulfed her, and the fiery flames drove her
back. Gasping, smothering, suffocating, she fought
her way out into the open air once more, and fell in
a huddled heap upon the ground in a dead swoon.</p>

<p>Through the horrible smoke and flames the heroic
sister made her way. It seemed as if she would never
reach the attic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The stairs had not burned away; the fire seemed not
to have reached them yet, and so she was able to toil
slowly and painfully through the smoke up to the
attic. It was a long and weary task, for the black
smoke was thick and awful, and the red hot flames
scorched her as she went. On&mdash;on! Was it hours or
days since she started? On&mdash;on! The attic was
reached at last, and blinded by the smoke, and gasping
feebly for breath, Sister Angela threw open the door
of her room.</p>

<p>The child was lying in its little cradle; it had just
awakened, and was crying bitterly. The good sister
flew to its side and lifted it in her arms. It was only
a little babe&mdash;a sickly little creature, born of poor and
unknown parents&mdash;but it was one of Christ's little
ones, and this holy woman was about to die for its
sake. She flew to the door of the room with the babe
in her arms, held close to her breast, full of the divine
mother-love which forms a part of the nature of all
good women, and upon the threshold she came to a
frightened halt. The smoke and flames filled the corridor,
and beyond&mdash;beyond there loomed up a solid
wall of fire, while smoke and flames wound around the
doomed staircase and wrapped it in crimson folds.</p>

<p>For a moment the heroic woman stood, still holding
the child in her arms&mdash;the child for whom and with
whom she was about to die&mdash;her eyes fixed helplessly
upon the flame-wreathed staircase, cut off from all
hope. Then she went swiftly back to the room and
over to the one window. She flung it open, and still
clasping the child, stood there uttering piercing shrieks.</p>

<p>Some one heard her, and a ladder was swung up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
at once. Sister Angela drew forth her rosary, and
with the child held close to her breast, began to pray,
her face like the face of a saint reflected in the lurid
light from the conflagration. The ladder was adjusted,
but too late; the flames darted forth and seized it in
deadly embrace. The whole house tottered now upon
its foundations. Only the white face of the sister at
the upper window, with the child in her arms. That
picture will be remembered by those who saw it to
their dying day. Only a poor, obscure Sister of Charity&mdash;a
lowly life lived out amid the poor and the fallen
and suffering. But who shall say that it was lived in
vain?</p>

<p>And now another ladder was swung, but just as
one of the brave and heroic firemen was about to step
upon it and risk his own life, in a mad attempt to
save the heroic woman above, the structure trembled
violently, and the burning house gave way, the entire
wing of the building falling with a horrible crash, and
the white, saintly face at the upper window, with the
babe upon her breast, the pale lips framing prayers,
while the enraptured eyes gazed far above at that
Heaven which she was so soon to enter, was seen no
more&mdash;will never be seen again in this world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out in the cool night air Beatrix had managed to
drag Keith, but at last he had fallen, faint and exhausted,
to the ground, and Beatrix fell upon her knees
at his side.</p>

<p>The first faint gleam of the early morning began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to creep into the eastern sky, and still the crowd lingered
about the smoking ruins, though there seemed
no more to be done.</p>

<p>Beatrix was making up her mind to send for a cab
in which to convey Keith to his home at old Bernard
Dane's. It was the place for him to go, but she&mdash;she&mdash;must
she seek refuge in that horrible place, the
lepers' hospital, after all?</p>

<p>It was a grewsome thought, and as she realized
what it meant to her and to Keith&mdash;the endless separation,
the death in life&mdash;for the first time since she
had learned of this awful sorrow, her own dark inheritance,
the poor girl felt that she "could curse God
and die!" And how could she know of the great good
in store, the wonderful and unexpected blessing which
God was about to bestow upon her? So it often is
with us poor mortals. Just at the darkest hours of our
lives the light is breaking, though hidden from our
eyes.</p>

<p>At last Doctor Darrow, smoke-blackened and burned
in several places, made his way to Beatrix's side. He
gazed full into her face with a strange, intent look,
as though seeking to read her very heart. From his
lips there issued a low cry, which sounded like a cry
of joy.</p>

<p>"God be praised!" he ejaculated. "Beatrix, listen
to me: out of all this evil some good has come. You
have been unconsciously subjected to the fire test, and
you are burned, severely burned. Get down on your
knees, and thank God for those scars, dear Beatrix,
for they prove a glorious truth. Had you escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
from the fire uninjured, there would have been no
doubt that the horrible scourge of leprosy existed in
your system. But, Beatrix, Beatrix! you are badly
burned, and&mdash;look up, dear friend&mdash;you are free from
the taint of leprosy; there is no mistake!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HOW THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED.</p>


<p>Pale and dazed, Beatrix gazed into the young physician's
face. Could it be possible? Were his words
true? Was there a hope that she might, after all escape
the dreadful scourge, the awful curse, and be restored
to her rightful place in the world, no longer an
outcast, no longer looked upon as a thing of horror, an
object of aversion? It seemed too good to be true.
She fell backward a little, trembling like a leaf. Doctor
Darrow caught her in his arms and placed her on
a seat near by. Keith, who had recovered from the
swoon into which he had fallen after his rescue from
the burning building, could only gaze into her face,
not able to speak a word.</p>

<p>"Let us drive at once to Mr. Dane's," Doctor Darrow's
voice broke the silence which followed. "I will
explain to Mr. Dane, and I see no reason why you
should not be restored to your old place there, Mrs.
Kenyon."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his with a look of gratitude. Then
all at once it flashed across her mind that the old
house had a new ruler now. Serena was its real head,
its tyrannical mistress. Could she go back there?
Would Serena allow it? And could she be happy under
the same roof which Serena claimed as her own? In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
few words she expressed her doubts and fears. Keith's
eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"If you do not accompany me, I shall not go there,"
he exclaimed; "so that settles it! Where you go, Beatrix,
I shall go. No one shall separate us again. And
if Doctor Darrow is right in his conjectures, there is
no longer the shadow of a reason for our separation.
Beatrix, darling wife, happy days are drawing near,
thank God!"</p>

<p>A cab having arrived, Doctor Darrow helped the
two into it, and took his own seat opposite.</p>

<p>"I had better go with you," he said, "for I wish
to explain to Mr. Dane. It is time that this cloud
should be lifted from Mrs. Kenyon's life."</p>

<p>"We will be only too glad to have you accompany
us," returned Keith, heartily.</p>

<p>And so they drove away together&mdash;away from the
ruins of the Home&mdash;the funeral pyre of one of the
noblest of women&mdash;and were soon in the aristocratic
portion of the city.</p>

<p>At last the cab halted before the door of the Dane
mansion. A dilapidated trio&mdash;hatless, soiled, and
weary&mdash;they were ushered into the presence of Mr.
and Mrs. Bernard Dane.</p>

<p>At sight of the visitors, Serena arose majestically.</p>

<p>"Simons,"&mdash;in a commanding tone&mdash;"these people
are not received here; show them out."</p>

<p>"Serena!" Old Bernard Dane darted forward, his
face pale, his form trembling. "You are going a little
too far. These are my adopted son and daughter. I
forbid you to insult or show them any rudeness. Doctor
Darrow is a highly prized friend. Be seated, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
you. Simons, bring some wine and a little cold chicken
or something to refresh us. We had just read in the
morning paper of the fire," he added, turning to Keith
as he spoke. "I was about to go and see what had become
of you; but the paper stated that no one was
killed; no lives lost in the flames but the good Sister of
Charity and the little child; so I felt relieved upon that
score. Ah! here comes Simons. Now you all must
eat and drink, for I must confess you look pretty badly
used up."</p>

<p>They needed no second invitation, and when the
repast was over and they felt strengthened and refreshed,
Doctor Darrow proceeded to tell his story,
ending by expressing his opinion, professionally, that
Beatrix had escaped the awful scourge.</p>

<p>"I think that there is no room for doubt upon the
subject," the physician said, in conclusion. "I have
never known the fire test to fail."</p>

<p>"Doctor De Trobriand told me of it," intervened old
Bernard Dane, excitedly. "He said that if I could
in any way expose Beatrix to the action of fire, I would
prove beyond a doubt if she were really afflicted with
leprosy. You understand my cruel treatment of you
now, Beatrix, do you not, that night, long ago, when I
tried to induce you to put your hand into the fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember, Uncle Bernard," she returned,
"and I must confess that at the time I was awfully
frightened. I thought that you had suddenly lost your
reason."</p>

<p>"No wonder!"&mdash;the old man smiled grimly. "And
now I suppose you all need rest; and Beatrix certainly
must have those burns dressed. Lucky that her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
has escaped injury. Go upstairs to the blue room,
Beatrix."</p>

<p>But Serena barred the way.</p>

<p>"I am mistress here!" she snarled, "and I say that
no leprous person shall remain under my roof. It was
proved beyond a doubt that her mother, Mildred Dane,
was afflicted with the dreadful disease. How then
do you know how soon it will show itself in Beatrix,
her child? The parent always transmits the disease
to the children. There is no mistake upon that point;
no avoiding the truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken!"</p>

<p>Doctor Darrow's voice broke in upon Serena's angry
tirade.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for the contradiction, Mrs.
Dane, but you are mistaken. Let me give you an instance
of the truth, which proves that the disease is not
always transmitted to the children direct from the
parents. It may lie in abeyance for two or three generations,
and then appear in the next. The story that
I am about to relate to you, with your permission, is
true, and I repeat it from the written notes of a physician&mdash;a
friend of mine&mdash;who was well acquainted
with the parties concerned:</p>

<p>"I used to know a Cuban hero&mdash;a revolutionist&mdash;who
had been run out of his native island by the government.
He was the son of a rich planter, had been
well educated in France and Spain, and had many accomplishments.
He went to New York, and into the
cigar business, and soon became wealthy. He married
a New York girl and had a family. He had grown
to be immensely rich, and lived in grand style, drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
blooded horses, and owned his own opera-box. One
night he had a long consultation with the family physician
in a private room in his elegant mansion. When
the doctor left, the Cuban said to his wife in a careless
tone: 'Let us go down to Delmonico's, my dear, and
have supper.' They went, and the two passed the gayest,
merriest evening imaginable.</p>

<p>"A little after midnight they returned home. She
went to bed and fell asleep, the lights still burning in
the house. Just as the first faint streaks of dawn began
to appear in the eastern sky, she awoke with a cold
chill creeping over her. Some instinct warned her that
evil had occurred.</p>

<p>"She rose and sought her husband. She found him
in his private room, lying on the floor, stone dead, with
a revolver still grasped in one cold hand. He had
spent the night arranging his affairs. He had left her
many tender messages, which told of his love for her
and his children, and tender kisses for the dear ones
whose lips he dared not press himself.</p>

<p>"That interview with his family physician had betrayed
the secret to him. Leprosy, which had occurred
among his ancestors generations before, had declared
itself in him, and he had taken the shortest way of
doctoring it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"ALL'S WELL."</p>


<p>There was silence in the room when Doctor Darrow
finished his story&mdash;silence broken at length by Serena's
cold, harsh voice.</p>

<p>"But that does not prove that Beatrix is exempt
from the curse entailed upon her," she said, coarsely.
"I consider her unfit to associate with other people
until the exact truth is proved, and I decline to receive
her here in my house. I will not expose myself and
others to possible contagion. And, besides, the very
thought of having such a horror under one's roof is not
agreeable, I can tell you. I think, Doctor Darrow, that
you, as a physician, would be better employed with
something else, than in trying to impose a case like this
upon Mr. Dane and myself!"</p>

<p>Doctor Darrow colored.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mrs. Dane," he began, coldly, "that
Mrs. Kenyon is free from the awful taint. You need
not be uneasy."</p>

<p>But Serena only tossed her head with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I do not intend to be!" she cried. "Mrs. Kenyon
is nothing to me. It does not matter to me what becomes
of her. She has made trouble always where-ever
she went. But she shall certainly not remain
under my roof!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dane!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Keith Kenyon came to Serena's side and gazed into
her angry face with eyes full of calm contempt.</p>

<p>"You need say no more. My wife shall not trouble
you, or infringe upon your hospitality any longer than
is absolutely necessary, for she is not altogether penniless.
Mrs. Ray bequeathed her little property to Beatrix."</p>

<p>"Aunt Celia!" Serena's voice rang out shrill and
sharp. "Oh, no, Keith, that is impossible. She has
always intended mamma to have her property; and
mamma is her only relative, and according to law is
entitled to the estate."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ray's will says differently," returned Keith,
coldly. "It matters little to us, however; we can exist
without the legacy; but these are cold facts, Mrs. Dane,
as I will prove to you at any time. But we will not
trouble you now, or remain as unwelcome guests.
Come Beatrix."</p>

<p>Bernard Dane sprang forward, pale and excited.</p>

<p>"No, you shall not go!" he cried. "This is my
house; nay, more&mdash;it is yours, Beatrix. You shall not
go. Do not mind what Serena says; you have more
right here than she has!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dane!" Serena's voice trembled with suppressed
anger. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean this!"</p>

<p>Old Bernard Dane faced the angry woman with unflinching
eyes.</p>

<p>At that very moment Beatrix's slight form began to
sway unsteadily, and she fell to the floor in a dead
faint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Bernard Dane, excitedly,
"here we stand dickering over a foolish matter, and
poor Beatrix is suffering. Doctor, her burns must be
attended to at once. Mrs. Graves will help her to bed;
she must be taken care of."</p>

<p>Doctor Darrow was already busily engaged in removing
the scorched and tattered bodice of Beatrix's
dress from about the beautiful white neck and arms.
As he did so, a package of papers fell from the bosom
of her dress to the floor. Bernard Dane stooped and
picked them up. It was the package of papers which
Celia Ray had intrusted to the care of Beatrix. As
his eyes fell upon these papers the old man uttered a
cry of surprise. Drawing his spectacles from his
pocket, he put them on, and eagerly opened the package.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he ejaculated; then turning aside
he sank into a seat and began to read the papers carefully.</p>

<p>He started up and faced Serena, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he cried, in an awful voice, "and before
you enact the rôle of grand lady and turn your betters
from your doors, first find out if they are your doors.
Serena Lynne, go home to your mother as soon as you
see fit. You have no right here. You are not my
wife!"</p>

<p>A horrible silence fell over the room, and over the
astonished group. Unable to speak, Serena stood glaring
into the old man's angry face.</p>

<p>"Explain, Uncle Bernard!" said Keith.</p>

<p>"I will. In the first place, I must confess my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
crime. Years ago Celia Ray first began to care for me,
but I was madly in love with Mildred Dane, and would
not think of any other woman. Still, Celia continued
to care for me, and her love lived as long as she did.
It was the only unselfish affection ever bestowed upon
me. But I was a villain; and although at last seeing
that my love for Mildred was vain, I consented to
make Celia my wife, secretly resolved that the
marriage should not be legally solemnized. I have
nothing to say in extenuation of my own villainy, only
I have suffered since that time more pangs of conscience
than enough to atone. Well, the marriage was
gone through with, and she believed herself my wife.
One child was born to us&mdash;a girl&mdash;who died in infancy.
After a time I told her the truth&mdash;that we
were not legally married, and that we had better separate.
She went away, and for years we did not meet.
And now she is dead, and it is too late to atone! But
these papers prove, beyond a doubt, a surprising truth,
which she knew for years, but was too proud to break
to me. She only begged me never to marry, and
trusted to my honor to keep my word. But here is the
truth. Our marriage was legal! Here is every proof.
Serena, you have never been my wife. The fortune
for which you married me could not be yours, anyway,
for the wealth in my possession was willed to me by
Mildred Dane, as she inherited it from my relative,
Godfrey Dane, and it was long ago given to Keith
Kenyon by deed of gift."</p>

<p>Doctor Darrow was eagerly glancing over the papers
in his hand. All at once he uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen!" he panted, breathlessly. "Why, it is miraculous!"</p>

<p>And then he went on to read Celia Ray's dying confession.
When Bernard Dane had taken poor Mildred
and her child to the distant North, hoping to prolong
her life for a time, Celia had followed them. It
was Mildred's child that had died, and Celia had substituted
her own in place of it. For she had falsely
represented that it was dead, with the hope of bringing
about a substitution some day.</p>

<p>So the truth dawned upon the group, and Beatrix,
recovered from her swoon, listened with bated breath,
and it seemed more than Bernard Dane could bear&mdash;this
sudden change from grief to happiness. Beatrix
was his own child&mdash;Celia Ray's little child! The
tainted blood of Mildred Dane's ancestors did not flow
in her veins. Every necessary proof accompanied Mrs.
Ray's deposition&mdash;there was no room for doubt.</p>

<p>And so the black clouds rolled away from the lives
of Beatrix and Keith, the two who had loved each
other so devotedly, and who had so nearly been parted
by an awful fate; and Beatrix thanked God that she
had been permitted to cheer her dying mother's pathway
to the grave.</p>

<p>Serena and Mrs. Lynne left New Orleans forever
and returned to the North; but first Beatrix nobly
settled upon them the little fortune which Celia Ray,
her own mother&mdash;how strange it all seemed!&mdash;had bequeathed
to her.</p>

<p>And now, as happy as mortals can be, Beatrix and
Keith Kenyon live in the grand old Dane mansion with
the old man whose wickedness had so nearly wrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
both their lives. He is a repentant old man now&mdash;good
and kind to everybody. Doctor Darrow is a welcome
visitor there, and a bonny boy with soft, dark eyes and
golden hair is called Douglas Darrow Kenyon, while
a golden-haired tot of three years&mdash;a veritable sunbeam&mdash;is
named Angela. And every day of her life
Beatrix Kenyon thanks God from the depths of her
grateful heart for saving her from that fearful curse&mdash;her
dark inheritance.</p>
